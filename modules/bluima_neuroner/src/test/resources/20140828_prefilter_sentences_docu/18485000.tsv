Summary  When grown as a biofilm in laboratory flow chambers Pseudomonas aeruginosa can develop mushroomshaped multicellular structures consisting of distinct subpopulations in the cap and stalk portions. In the present study we examine additional factors involved in the formation of this multicellular substructure. Experiments involving DNase treatment of developing biofilms provided evidence that extracellular DNA plays a role in cap formation. These results constitute evidence that type IV pili, flagellummediated motility and quorum sensing-controlled DNA release are involved in the formation of mature multicellular structures in P. aeruginosa biofilms. For example, flat biofilms are formed in flow chambers irrigated with citrate minimal medium (Klausen et al., 2003a), while heterogeneous biofilms with mushroom-shaped multicellular structures are formed in flow chambers irrigated with glucose minimal medium (Klausen et al., 2003b). The extracellular matrix that holds the cells together in P. aeruginosa biofilms mainly consists of polysaccharide, protein and DNA (for a recent review see Pamp et al., 2007). Evidence has been presented that a basal level of extracellular DNA in P. aeruginosa populations is generated via a pathway which is not linked to quorum sensing, while a larger amount of extracellular DNA appears to be generated via a pathway that depends on quorum sensing and results in lysis of a small subpopulation of the cells (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006). The P. aeruginosa quorumsensing mutants, lasIrhlI and pqsA, formed biofilms that had low extracellular DNA levels and increased susceptibility to treatment with SDS, indicating that the extracellular DNA in wild-type biofilms has a stabilizing effect (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006). The extracellular DNA in P. aeruginosa biofilms appears to be organized in distinct patterns (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006). In young glucose-grown P. aeruginosa biofilms the extracellular DNA was shown to be present in high concentrations specifically in the outer layer of the microcolonies and upon the microcolonies (which subsequently became stalks). In mature glucose-grown P. aeruginosa biofilms the extracellular DNA was shown to be present in high concentrations specifically in the outer layer of the stalks and between the stalk and cap portion of the mushroom-shaped structures (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006). In agreement with the spatial distribution of the extracellular DNA and a role of quorum sensing in DNA release, experiments involving a P. aeruginosa pqsA-gfp reporter strain provided evidence that the pqs genes were  expressed specifically in the outer layer of the stalks that subsequently became capped by the migrating subpopulation (Yang et al., 2007). By this method it is possible to assess motility of cells close to the substratum in the early phase of biofilm formation, but due to technical limitations of confocal laser scanning microscopy microscopy it is not possible to assess motility of cells far from the substratum in the later stages of biofilm development. However, in chpA early-phase biofilms only non-motile cells were observed (data not shown). From the experiments with the pilH and chpA mutants we conclude that the Chp chemosensory system plays a minor role in the formation of the mushroom-shaped multicellular structures in P. aeruginosa biofilms. Involvement of flagella and the Che chemotaxis system in the structural development of P. aeruginosa biofilms  The fact that a mixture of Cfp-tagged and Yfp-tagged P. aeruginosa wild-type bacteria forms mushroom-shaped biofilm structures with single-colour stalks and two-colour caps (Klausen et al., 2003b) clearly indicates a role of cellular migration in mushroom cap formation in P. aeruginosa biofilms. Involvement of extracellular DNA in the structural development of P. aeruginosa biofilms  The work described above indicated that formation of the cap of the mushroom-shaped structures in P. aeruginosa biofilms is dependent on flagellum-driven motility and the chemotaxis system. To begin to understand the requirement for type IV pili in cap formation we turned our attention to the extracellular biofilm matrix. Extracellular DNA has previously been shown to be particularly abundant in the outer layer of the microcolonies in young P. aeruginosa biofilms, and between the stalk and cap portion of the mushroom-shaped structures  Fig. We speculated that the large amounts of extracellular DNA present on the microcolonies in young P. aeruginosa biofilms might cause accumulation of the migrating piliated bacteria, and thereby play a role in the formation of the mushroom caps. If cap formation is dependent on interactions between type IV pili and extracellular DNA, then the morphology of the caps may be dependent on the level of surface piliation on the capforming bacteria, which might explain the differences in cap morphology displayed by the P. aeruginosa wild type, pilH and chpA mutants. Although the extracellular DNA in P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms has a stabilizing function (Whitchurch et al., 2002; Allesen-Holm et al., 2006), we have found that under the conditions used in the present study DNase treatment of 2-day-old P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms does not result in dispersal of the biofilms (data not shown). We hypothesized that, if the extracellular DNA present on the microcolonies in 2-day-old P. aeruginosa biofilms plays a role in accumulation of the cap-forming bacteria, then DNase treatment of the biofilms from day 2 might inhibit cap formation. Staining of the extracellular DNA in the biofilm, using our previously  described methods (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006), showed that residual extracellular DNA was present after the DNase treatment (data not shown), which may explain why cap formation was reduced but not abolished. We further studied the role of extracellular DNA in the development of the mushroom-shaped P. aeruginosa biofilm structures via a genetic approach. esized that if a pilA mutant carried additional mutations so that it was unable to release extracellular DNA, it would form microcolonies that could not be capped by the wild type in mixed biofilms. Assessment of extracellular DNA using our previously described assays (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006) confirmed that the P. aeruginosa pilAlasRrhlR mutant is deficient in DNA release when it is grown in flow chambers (data not shown). Discussion  In the present study, we present new findings that enable us to further suggest steps involved in the formation of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures in P. aeruginosa biofilms. Our previous studies constitute evidence that the stalk portion of these multicellular structures is formed by non-motile bacteria whereas the cap portion is formed by migrating bacteria via a process that depends on type IV pili (Klausen et al., 2003a). In the current work we present evidence that cap formation depends on: (i) type IV pili, but not type IV pili-mediated motility, (ii) flagellummediated motility and the chemotaxis system, and (iii) extracellular DNA released by the stalk subpopulation. We have previously proposed that type IV pili are necessary for cap formation because of a role in cellular migration (Klausen et al., 2003a). In agreement with our suggestion that type IV piliation of the cells is required for mushroom cap formation, whereas type IV pili-mediated motility is not necessary, Chiang and Burrows (2003) reported that a P. aeruginosa pilT mutant, which is hyper-piliated and twitching deficient, formed biofilms with large mushroom-shaped structures. Our data, together with previously published studies, suggest that stalk formation may initiate in certain foci of a P. aeruginosa biofilm as a consequence of downregulation of motility in a subpopulation of the cells. However, it is also possible that microcolony formation initiates because the cells in certain foci of the biofilms produce matrix compo-  nents and adhere strongly to each other so that motility becomes arrested. However, according to the computer simulations, the formation of the mature mushroom-shaped structures cannot be explained solely on the basis of random surfaceassociated migration of the motile subpopulation in combination with increased cell proliferation of the motile cells that settle on top of the stalk microcolonies. Furthermore, the computer simulations predicted that if motility and chemotaxis were the only factors in operation then vertical strings of cells would be formed in the biofilms. Based on our present and previous findings we propose that development of the mushroomshaped structures in P. aeruginosa biofilms occurs in a sequential process that involves formation of initial microcolonies (stalks) by a non-motile subpopulation that releases extracellular DNA, and subsequently becomes capped by a motile subpopulation that uses flagellumdriven motility and the chemotaxis system for coordinated migration, and type IV pili for binding to the extracellular DNA. Although the proposed interaction between type IV pili and extracellular DNA can explain the requirement for type IV pili in cap formation it is at present purely speculative, and subject to further study in our laboratory.

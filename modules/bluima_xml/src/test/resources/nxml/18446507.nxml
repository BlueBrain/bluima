In this paper we analyze a family of nonlinear feedback models which has recently proved effective in modeling tolerance phenomena such as have been observed with SSRI&#x02019;s. We use dynamical systems methods to exhibit typical properties of the response-time course of these nonlinear models, such as overshoot and rebound, establish quantitive bounds and explore how these properties depend on the system and drug parameters.

Goodman and Gilman 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>)). Acute tolerance is also seen in an experimental setting in laboratory animals. Factors like dose rates and frequencies, and diurnal oscillations (S&#x000e4;llstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>) and Visser et al. 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>)) often manifest themselves as tolerance to the pharmacological activity of the test compound. In our own experience we then see how the rate and extent of an intravenous infusion may impact the onset, intensity and duration of <italic>e.g.</italic>, a cardiovascular response. Therefore, we believe that a parametric characterization of the rate and extent of tolerance development has a practical bearing on design and analyses of pharmacodynamic studies.</p><p>Over the years there have been several different approaches to modeling tolerance. We mention time-dependent attenuation of drug constants (cf. Colburn et al. 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>)), effect compartment models (Porchet et al. 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>) and Ouellet and Pollack 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>)), systems analysis (Urquhart and Li 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>) and 1969 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>), Veng-Pedersen et al. 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>)), pool/precursor models (Licko and Ekblad 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>), Bauer and Fung 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>) and Sharma et al. 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>), and feedback turnover models (Ackerman et al. 1964 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), Resigno and Segre 1961, 1966 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>), Holford et al. 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), Wakelkamp et al. 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), Agers&#x000f8; et al. 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>), Zuideveld et al. 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>), Lima et al. 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>), S&#x000e4;llstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>), Visser et al. 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>), and de Winter et al. 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>)).</p><p>In the present paper we focus on the latter and discuss in detail a family of nonlinear feedback models involving the response <italic>R</italic>, as well as a <italic>Moderator</italic><italic>M</italic>. One such model has recently been successfully used to model tolerance phenomena in SSRI&#x02019;s (Bundgaard 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>)). These models are based on the classic turnover Indirect Response models. However, tolerance is modeled through the intervention of a moderator, which acts to diminish the response created by the drug and which is generated by the response (cf. Gabrielsson and Peletier 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>)). The structure of one such model system is sketched in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Sketch of the basic feedback model and a typical response <italic>versus</italic> time course. The response <italic>R</italic> is governed by the zero-order turnover rate <italic>k</italic><sub>in</sub> and the first-order fractional turnover rate <italic>k</italic><sub>out</sub>, and then indirectly also controlled by a separate moderator <italic>M</italic>. The turnover of the moderator is governed by a single first-order rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>tol</sub>. The build-up of the moderator is <italic>k</italic><sub>tol</sub>&#x000b7;<italic>R</italic> and loss is <italic>k</italic><sub>tol</sub>&#x000b7;<italic>M</italic>. The moderator acts via inhibition of <italic>k</italic><sub>in</sub> on the production of response (as in the scheme above) or via stimulation of <italic>k</italic><sub>out</sub> (negative feedback). The solid lines denote flows and the dashed lines denote control action. In the response <italic>versus</italic> time course we note substantial overshoot and rebound</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12248_2008_9007_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The class of feedback models we discuss here is nonlinear in that an increase in <italic>M</italic> will reduce the production of <italic>R</italic> by a factor 1/<italic>M</italic>. Thus, the dynamic properties of these models, such as overshoot, rebound and presence of oscillatory behavior, depend on the state of the system, and so change when the system is taken by the drug from the baseline state <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> to a higher or a lower pharmacodynamic steady state <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub>. Specifically, this class of models is designed to have the following properties:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Rapid drug induced changes in the pharmacodynamic steady state yield pronounced <italic>overshoot</italic> and <italic>rebound.</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Inhibition</italic> of the loss term which <italic>raises</italic> the steady state <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub>, causes an overshoot which is <italic>larger</italic> than the rebound upon the return to the baseline after washout.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Stimulation</italic> of the loss term which <italic>lowers</italic> the steady state <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub>, causes an overshoot which is <italic>smaller</italic> than the rebound upon the return to the baseline after washout.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Similar behavior is found when the production term is stimulated or inhibited.</p><p>It is the characteristic shape of these response curves: a large overshoot with respect to the new pharmacodynamic steady state when <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub> &#x0003e; <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> and a large rebound upon return to the baseline when <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub> &#x0003c; <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, and the difference in magnitude of these two, which we want to study in this paper. An important factor in determining the size of overshoot or rebound is the <italic>rate</italic> of input or removal of the drug in relation to the intrinsic rates of the system. We show how a rapid input or removal tends to cause a large overshoot or rebound, whilst a gradual input or removal tends to suppress overshoot or rebound.</p><p>We demonstrate the effectiveness of this class of models by fitting system and drug parameters to data sets obtained for three <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (see also Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Viewing the evolution of the system as an <italic>Orbit</italic> in the (<italic>R</italic>, <italic>M</italic>)-plane gives valuable insight into the properties of the response <italic>versus</italic> time curve. Also, we shall see that the structure of the state space immediately reveals some of these properties, such as the tendency of the system towards overshoot when the response jumps to a <italic>higher</italic> value, whether at onset, when <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub> &#x0003e; <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> or at washout when <italic>R</italic><sub>ss</sub> &#x0003c; <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p><p>The plan of the paper is the following. We begin with an analysis of the main class of feedback models and exhibit a series of characteristic properties such as bounds for <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>, for overshoot and for rebound, and analyze how these characteristic properties depend on the different pharmacodynamic rate constants in the model (system properties). Important mathematical ingredients here will be (<italic>i</italic>) comparison with simpler systems and (<italic>ii</italic>) asymptotic methods. Then we use these results to discuss successively the data of the three examples exhibited in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. We also apply them to the data of Example II to demonstrate how the pharmacodynamic and kinetic constants in the model can be estimated from the response <italic>versus</italic> time course. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the system, we then return to the feedback model and present a geometric analysis of the dynamics in state space. We conclude with a discussion of the main results we obtain and the methods we use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>In this section we introduce the class of feedback systems and derive analytically a series of characteristic properties of its response <italic>versus</italic> time curves.

In the nonlinear model 8, the response is always positive, regardless of the values of the system and drug parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p><bold>Background</bold> From a drug discovery point of view many biological variables including the ones affected by drugs, are subject to adaptation and tolerance. In the description of the time course of the response to drugs, it may therefore be necessary to consider the endogenous feedback control as an intrinsic part of the pharmacodynamics. With still the same system parameters and properties, different drug parameters will result in different response-time courses and consequently different levels of onset, intensity, duration and adaptation.Does tolerance confound the estimability of system and drug parameters? Yes, particularly with slow drug kinetics relative to kinetics of response, and with a substantial baseline drift, unless data are rich and well-spaced such as in Examples II and III. Since tolerance/adaptation may develop on a totally different (slower) time scale than the primary response (<italic>k</italic><sub>out</sub>), this may result in unexpected (and unpredictable from acute dosing) responses at pharmacodynamic steady-state. We believe that not only tolerance per se, but tolerance coupled to a substantial rebound effect may jeopardize the clinical outcome of unscheduled drug holidays (missed doses) and temporarily result in clinically harmful rebound effects. Therefore, multiple dosing and continuous tracking of the pharmacodynamic effect will be necessary at two or more dose levels. The kappa parameter (<italic>k</italic><sub>tol</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>out</sub>) may also serve as an early indicator variable of how slow tolerance develops and therefore how long extended exposure is needed.In quantitative pharmacology, the physiology and the system need to be (<italic>i</italic>) condensed into a conceptual (picture) model that captures the main features, including rate limiting step(s). When the mechanism of action has been presented as a conceptual model, the latter then needs to be translated into (<italic>ii</italic>) equations, i.e., the mathematical model, e.g., of the rate process (quantitative pharmacological), which is implemented into the regression software package. This is the second condensation, because model parameters also need to be identifiable and estimable.The next step (<italic>iii</italic>) will be to add the statistical model (error and/or covariate models) to the regression model. This is, of course, of importance in most instances, but it also needs to be balanced against mechanism of action (including the mathematical structure) and supported by a thorough experimental design. We envision more of a focus on mechanistic/mathematical model building including emphasis on experimental design. However, pattern recognition and exploratory data analysis are more related to the art of successful model building than the pure mathematical/statistical regression.</p><p><bold>Examples</bold> The analysis in this paper has been anchored in data sets obtained from three examples.Example I covers rapid test compound kinetics, multiple provocations, washout dynamics, and a value of <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = <italic>k</italic><sub>tol</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>out</sub> which is less than 1. These combinations reveal the system properties and result in accurate and precise system and drug parameters. The pharmacological response exhibits adaptation and particularly extensive rebound.Example II covers rapid system kinetics, relatively slow washout of test compound and a substantial drift in the baseline. Again, the value of <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> is less than 1. The pharmacological response shows a pronounced overshoot, adaptation and a slow return towards baseline without any indication of a rebound. However, simulations also demonstrate rebound of this system provided rapid kinetics and stable baseline.Example III covers intravenous infusion at a 4-fold dose (exposure) range, slow washout of test compound and a stable baseline. The pharmacological response shows a rapid onset, superimposing response-time courses for the two highest doses and lack of rebound upon return towards the baseline. This time the value of <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> was much less than 1, but the slow pharmacokinetics of the test compound confounded the possibility of a rebound.The intravenous way of administration avoids confounding absorption processes and first-pass phenomena. In neither of the three examples, pharmacologically active metabolites are known to be involved.</p><p><bold>Initial Estimates</bold> Using the data set of Example II we have shown how initial estimates for system and drug parameters can be obtained from just a few critical properties of the response <italic>versus</italic> time curve, such as baseline, pharmacodynamic steady state and initial slope.</p><p><bold>Qualitative Analysis of the Model</bold> Using qualitative methods we have obtained a-priori estimates for the response <italic>versus</italic> time course, such as upper and lower bounds, rate of convergence to the pharmacodynamic steady state, and to the baseline and insight into the crucial importance of the ratio <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> of the rate constants for the moderator <italic>k</italic><sub>tol</sub> and the response <italic>k</italic><sub>out</sub>. Viewing the dynamics of the system as an orbit in the <italic>state space</italic> represented by the (<italic>R</italic>, <italic>M</italic>)&#x02014;plane has yielded valuable insight into the specific properties of the feedback model such as a tendency towards overshoot and rebound, and an &#x0201c;upward bias&#x0201d; in that the tendency towards overshoot tends to be larger if the response jumps <italic>up</italic> than when it jumps <italic>down</italic>.With the a-priori knowledge we have obtained for this class of feedback models it will be easier to assess before hand whether or not a given data set can be fruitfully modeled by a model of this type.</p><p><bold>Design</bold> What are study designs generally lacking in situations where we also have feedback, tolerance and adaptation? We advocate several dose levels coupled to different routes and rates of input, multiple dosing, re-dosing during overshoot, pharmacodynamic steady-state or during rebound. Multiple consecutive intravenous infusions were given to the system presented in Example I. This is an example of multiple perturbations of a system, which reveals the system properties nicely. Since adaptation is a time-phenomenon, experimental design also requires repeated provocations (repeated dosing, different rates and routes of administration) of the system that is being studied. There is no generic schedule for this, but multiple provocations for at least 3&#x02013;4 <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2ktol</sub>, coupled to washout dynamics with sufficient baseline data, are probably informative. In a subsequent series of papers we will demonstrate how multiple rates and durations of intravenous dosing, coupled to observations of pharmacology during and after the provocations (washout), may help to elucidate the rate limiting steps behind a physiological turnover system exhibiting rapid adaptation.We also advocate <italic>ex vivo</italic> plasma protein binding of the test compound for appropriate estimation of unbound exposure, since changes in plasma protein binding have been shown to affect the exponent (Hill coefficient) in the sigmoid <italic>E</italic><sub>max</sub> model when converting total to unbound concentrations. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> plasma protein binding has, in our experience, given different results compared to pooled in vitro plasma protein binding experiments. One may also need to consider dosing (infuse) potentially active metabolites if their potencies and/or exposure levels fall in the neighborhood of parent compound. Making model simulations prior to executing the full experiment also helps to set up a strategy for experimental design.A constant (stable) drug input is probably the least satisfactory design for a feedback experiment. For tolerant physiological systems we believe that the constant 24&#x000a0;hr exposure paradigm may be deleterious in that most physiological systems need to be reset to some extent at some point during each dosing interval for the system to be susceptible to a new dose.</p><p><bold>Final Conclusion</bold> We have demonstrated the flexibility of a class of turnover models in their ability to mimic overshoot, pharmacodynamic steady state, return to baseline and rebound. We anchored this analysis to three experimental data sets of varying complexity. Finally, we discuss analytical tools such as phase plane plots and show a strategy as to how to derive initial parameter estimates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The second author wishes to record his gratitude to the Center for BioDynamics at Boston University for the hospitality enjoyed during the writing of this review.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goodman</surname><given-names>L.

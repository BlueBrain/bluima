 #input__java: new String[]{"Basal body replication during estrogen-driven ciliogenesis in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) oviduct has been studied by stereomicroscopy, rotation photography, and serial section analysis. Two pathways for basal body production are described: acentriolar basal body formation (major pathway) where procentrioles are generated from a spherical aggregate of fibers; and centriolar basal body formation, where procentrioles are generated by the diplosomal centrioles. In both pathways, the first step in procentriole formation is the arrangement of a fibrous granule precursor into an annulus. A cartwheel structure, present within the lumen of the annulus, is composed of a central cylinder with a core, spoke components, and anchor filaments. Tubule formation consists of an initiation and a growth phase. The A tubule of each triplet set first forms within the wall material of the annulus in juxtaposition to a spoke of the cartwheel. After all nine A tubules are initiated, B and C tubules begin to form. The initiation of all three tubules occurs sequentially around the procentriole. Simultaneous with tubule initiation is a nonsequential growth of each tubule. The tubules lengthen and the procentriole is complete when it is about 200 mmicro long. The procentriole increases in length and diameter during its maturation into a basal body. The addition of a basal foot, nine alar sheets, and a rootlet completes the maturation process. Fibrous granules are also closely associated with the formation of these basal body accessory structures."}

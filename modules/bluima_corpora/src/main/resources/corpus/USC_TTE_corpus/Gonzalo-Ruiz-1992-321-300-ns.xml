  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">A number of reports have recently identified some of the 
    neurotransmitters involved in the efferent and afferent connections 
    of the mammillary complex (Storm-Mathisen and Opsahl, &apos;78; 
    Kiyama et al., &apos;84, &apos;86; Kovacs et al., &apos;85; Fujii 
    et d., &apos;87; Shibata and Furukawa, &apos;88).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">The dopaminergic systems have been particularly examined 
    in the rat hypothalamus by immunohistochemical localization of 
    tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Bjorklund and Nobin, &apos;73; Hokfelt 
    et al., &apos;76; Chan-Palay et al., &apos;84; van den Pol et al., 
    &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s14">Since catecholamine containing neurons in the 
    hypothalamus do not appear to be immunoreactive for the 
    norepinephrine synthesizing enzyme dopamine-p-hydroxylase (Swanson 
    and Hartman, &apos;751, immunohistochemistry with TH can be used to 
    study the dopamine systems of the hypothalamus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s15">In this region of the brain dopamine plays roles not only 
    as a neurotransmitter (Bjorklund et al., &apos;73; Hokfelt et al., 
    &apos;76; Kawano and Daikoku, &apos;87) but also as a hormone in 
    the hypothalamohypophysial axis (Tilders et al., &apos;79; Barnes 
    and Dyball, &apos;82; Rack6 et al., &apos;82).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s16">Immunohistochemical studies (Chan-Palay et al., &apos;84) 
    have also shown that the mammillary nuclei contain a relatively 
    high density of dopaminergic terminals.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s17">However, little attention has been paid to the origins of 
    the dopaminergic innervation of this complex.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s18">In this study we have examined TH-positive afferent 
    pathways to the mammillary body employing a combination of TH 
    immunohistochemistry and retrograde transport of wheat germ 
    agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP).</S>

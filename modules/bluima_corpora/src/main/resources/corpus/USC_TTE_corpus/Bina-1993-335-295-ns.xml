     id="s2">Cholinergic agents can alter circadian rhythm phase, and

     id="s3">Since there are no cholinergic somata in the

    of cholinergic neurons whose cell bodies are located elsewhere in 
    the brain.</S>

     id="s4">This study was aimed at locating the cholinergic neurons 
    that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus by retrograde and

    acetyltransferase in the rat.</S>

     id="s5">After injection of fluorogold, a retrograde tracer, into 
    the suprachiasmatic nucleus, retrogradely labelled neurons that 
    were immunopositive for choline acetyltransferase were located 
    throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the cholinergic basal nuclear 
    complex, with highest densities in the substantia innominata and 
    the nucleus basalis magnocellularis.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with 
    a period of about 24 hours.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">Under natural conditions these circadian rhythms are 
    synchronized to environmental cues such as illumination and 
    temperature cycles.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">In mammals, the generation of circadian rhythms in 
    behaviour and physiology and their synchronization to environmental 
    cues are regulated by neural mechanisms centered in the 
    suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s14">Evidence supporting this role for the SCN comes from a 
    variety of approaches (for reviews see Meijer and Rietveld, 
    &apos;89; Rusak, &apos;89; Hastings et al., &apos;91).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s15">Brief light pulses administered to animals maintained in 
    continuous darkness are capable of shifting the phase of their 
    behavioural and physiological rhythms in a direction which depends 
    on the time of administration of the pulse.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s16">Light exposure in the early subjective night delays, and 
    in the late subjective night advances, the onset of activity 
    rhythms (DeCoursey, &apos;64; Daan and Pittendrigh, &apos;76; 
    Pittendrigh and Daan, &apos;76).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s17">Such phase-dependent responses can be summarized as a 
    phase response curve, plotting the type of phase shift produced 
    against the circadian phase of application.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s18">The phase response curve for intraventricularly 
    administered carbachol, a nonspecific cholinergic agonist, has been 
    shown to mimic partially the pattern of sensitivity to the phase 
    shifting effects of light in rats, mice and hamsters (Zatz and 
    Brownstein, &apos;79; Zatz and Herkenham, &apos;81; Earnest and 
    Turek, &apos;83,&apos;85; Meijer et al., &apos;88; Bina and Rusak, 
    &apos;91), suggesting that acetylcholine (ACh) may play a role in 
    the photic entrainment pathway.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s19">Additional evidence for a cholinergic role comes from 
    evidence that nicotinic receptor antagonists block the phase 
    shifting effects of light on pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase 
    (Zatz and Brownstein, &apos;81) and locomotor activity (Keefe et 
    al., &apos;87).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s20">Electrophysiological studies have shown that cells in the 
    SCN are responsive to iontophoretically applied ACh, both in vivo 
    and in vitro (Nishino and Koizumi, &apos;77; Kow and Pfaff, 
    &apos;84; Miller et al., &apos;871, implicating the existence of 
    cholinergic receptors within the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s21">However, evidence against the presence of such receptors 
    exists (for review, see Rusak and Bina, &apos;90).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s22">In brief, the rat SCN itself is not labelled with either 
    3H-acetylcholine or 3H-nicotine (Segal et al., &apos;78; Clarke et 
    al., &apos;85; van der Zee et al., &apos;911, but a-bungarotoxin 
    binds to sites in a region dorsal and lateral to the SCN (Segal et 
    al., &apos;78; Block and Billiar, &apos;81; Miller et al., 
    &apos;82; Fuchs and Hoppens, &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s23">It is known, however, that a-bungarotoxin binds strongly 
    to nicotinic receptors in the peripheral nervous system (Martin et 
    al., &apos;89) but not to those in the central nervous system 
    (Clarke et al., &apos;85).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s24">Fibres containing choline acetyltransferase (CUT), the 
    biosynthetic enzyme for ACh, have been localized in the rat SCN 
    (van den Pol and Tsujimoto, &apos;85; Ichikawa and Hirata, 
    &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s25">In the absence of evidence for ChAT in SCN neurons, these 
    fibres can be assumed to derive from sources extrinsic to the 
    SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s26">However, the location of the neurons which contribute 
    these fibres is not known.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s27">The SCN receives a projection from cells in the basal 
    forebrain (Pickard, &apos;821, a region that is known to contain 
    cholinergic neurons.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s28">Therefore, this region appears to be a likely source of 
    the cholinergic projection to the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s29">Consistent with this possibility, Fuller et al. 
    (&apos;89) reported in an abstract that neurons in the diagonal 
    band of Broca project to the SCN and also contain 
    acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the degradation 
    of ACh.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s30">The present study was carried out in rats to clarify the 
    anatomy of cholinergic input to the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s31">The study involved visualization of fibres and fibre 
    terminals immunopositive for ChAT in the SCN by means of a 
    sensitive immunocytochemical technique (Ojima et al., &apos;88) to 
    confirm the presence of cholinergic fibres in the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s32">Then a retrograde tracer, fluorogold, was injected into 
    the SCN, in combination with immunohistochemistry for CUT, to 
    identify cholinergic neurons in the forebrain and brainstem (major 
    brain areas containing cholinergic projection neurons) as afferent 
    sources of these fibres.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s33">These projections were further confirmed by injecting an 
    anterograde tracer, biocytin, into the brainstem cholinergic nuclei 
    and visualizing biocytin-labelled fibres and terminals in the 
    SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s36">Three separate sets of experiments were carried out to 
    identify cholinergic cells which project to the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s37">The first study used a sensitive immunocytochemical 
    method to visualize fibres and terminals expressing ChAT 
    immunoreactivity in the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s38">The second study involved retrograde tracing with 
    fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Englewood, CO) as the tracer, injected 
    into the SCN, and evaluation of both forebrain and brainstem 
    cholinergic cell regions as potential sources of the cholinergic 
    projections.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s39">The third set of studies used biocytin (Sigma Chemical 
    Co., St.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s40">Louis, MO) as an anterograde tracer, which was injected 
    into brainstem cholinergic nuclei.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s41">Anterograde studies were not performed for projections 
    from the forebrain because, in comparison to cholinergic neurons in 
    the brainstem, forebrain cholinergic neurons are more diffusely 
    distributed, and very large injections spanning, but also 
    restricted to, the entire rostrocaudal extent of the cholinergic 
    basal nuclear complex would have been very difficult to produce.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s42">In addition, the cholinergic nature of the anterogradely 
    labelled fibres could not be confirmed because although the 
    combination of ChAT immunofluorescence and fluorescence-conjugated 
    avidin for biocytin would be a most suitable method for this 
    purpose, the immunofluorescence of ChAT-positive fibres in the SCN 
    was not sufficiently intense to permit clear identification of 
    double labelling, with the protocol used in the present study (see 
    below).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s43">Two different antibodies to ChAT were used in the present 
    study: a monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim, Montreal), and a 
    polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit (Chemicon International, 
    Temecula, CA).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s44">The specificity of both antibodies has previously been 
    documented (Eckenstein and Thoenen, &apos;82; Bruce et al., 
    &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s45">It was also initially confirmed in a double 
    immunofluorescence experiment that the two antibodies label 
    identical cell populations.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s46">In some cases where both antibodies were tried in 
    conjunction with retrograde labelling, the pattern of labelling was 
    the same.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s47">However, background staining with the two antibodies 
    varied to some extent depending on the tissue under investigation, 
    as well as the protocol used.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s48">Thus, for the best results, in the experiment which 
    examined CUT-immunoreactive fibres, the monoclonal antibody was 
    used preferentially, because the protocol used in this experiment, 
    originally developed by Ojima et al. (&apos;881, specifically 
    required the use of this antibody for visualizing fibres.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s49">In the retrograde labelling study, the polyclonal 
    antibody was usually used to process brain sections because it 
    appeared to provide slightly clearer staining with less background, 
    especially for immunofluorescence.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s50">For retinal sections, however, the monoclonal antibody 
    was used preferentially because the use of this antibody in our 
    protocol resulted in clearer staining with less background in 
    retinal tissues.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s51">It should be noted, however, that despite these slight 
    differences, the two antibodies clearly identified the same 
    populations of cholinergic neurons.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="methods.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    may be due to the type of tracer used.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s175">Fluorogold has been shown to be superior to horseradish 
    peroxidase as a retrograde tracer, and its sensitivity is 
    reportedly comparable to that of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish 
    peroxidase (Schmued and Fallon, &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s176">It has also been reported that fluorogold is not taken 
    up by undamaged fibres of passage, and that there is little or no 
    transsynaptic labelling, since long survival times do not appear to 
    result in increased cell labelling (Schmued and Fallon, 
    &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s177">Another possible explanation for the disparity between 
    the two studies is species differences, since the study by Pickard 
    (&apos;82) was done using Syrian hamsters rather than rats.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s178">Although not identified in the present study, the 
    presence of short cholinergic projections to the SCN arising in an 
    anterior hypothalamic region lateral to the SCN has previously been 
    reported in two abstracts.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s179">Fuller et al. (&apos;89) used AChE histochemistry as a 
    marker for cholinergic cells and horseradish peroxidase as a 
    retrograde tracer, and reported double-labelled cells in the 
    diagonal band and an area lateral to and beyond the boundary of the 
    SCN (referred to as &apos;LASCN,&apos; not to be confused with the 
    lateral SCN) in the rat.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s180">Although AChE is not a selective marker for cholinergic 
    neurons (Satoh et al., &apos;831, a similar result was found by 
    Dwyer et al. (&apos;90) in the hamster, by using 
    immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal antibody to ChAT and 
    rhodamine-conjugated latex microspheres as the retrograde 
    tracer.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s181">The presence of cholinergic neurons in the regions 
    surrounding the SCN is controversial, because although these 
    regions appear to contain ChAT-immunoreactive neurons (Tago et al., 
    &apos;871, no neurons containing mRNA for ChAT are present (Oh et 
    al., &apos;92).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    found in the area lateral to the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s183">This difference between our results and those of Fuller 
    et al. (&apos;89) and Dwyer et al. (&apos;90) may be attributable 
    to species differences or differences in the sensitivity of the 
    antibodies used.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s184">On the other hand, while neurons bearing cholinergic 
    markers may exist lateral to the SCN, we found no evidence of 
    retrograde labelling in this region.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s185">Since our fluorogold tracing identified other 
    projections to the SCN that had been described previously, the 
    sensitivity of the retrograde tracer does not appear to be a 
    problem.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s186">On the basis of these data, therefore, it seems unlikely 
    to us that the rat SCN receives a projection from neurons in this 
    region lateral to the SCN.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s187">In the brainstem, retrogradely labelled cholinergic 
    neurons were localized in three distinct nuclei, namely the PPT, 
    PBg and LDT.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s188">As previously reported (Tago et al., &apos;89), the PPT 
    and LDT contain strongly ChAT-positive neurons, whereas neurons in 
    the PBg are only weakly ChAT-immunoreactive.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s189">A recent study using in situ hybridization has reported 
    high levels of mRNA for ChAT in the PPT and LDT, but very low 
    levels in the PBg (Oh et al., &apos;92).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s190">Previous studies do not report fibre labelling in the 
    SCN following injections of the anterograde tracers wheat germ 
    agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or Phaseolus 
    uulgaris-leucoagglutinin into the LDT (Satoh and Fibiger, &apos;86; 
    Cornwall et al., &apos;go), whereas following the injection of 
    Phaseolus uulgaris-leucoagglutinin into the PPT, although not noted 
    by the authors, labelled fibres appear to be present in the SCN 
    (Hallanger and Wainer, &apos;88; their Fig. 3D).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s191">Consistent with the latter observation, retrogradely 
    labelled neurons have been observed in the PPT region following 
    horseradish peroxidase injections into the retrochiasmatic area and 
    caudal part of the SCN (Zaborszky et al., &apos;84).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s192">The present retrograde labelling data also suggest that 
    in addition to cholinergic projections from the PPT and LDT 
    regions, there are also projections arising from noncholinergic 
    neurons that are mixed with cholinergic neurons in the same 
    regions.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s193">This provides one explanation for the fact that the 
    density of fibres anterogradely labelled with biocytin from the 
    PPT, LDT, or PBg was greater than that of ChAT-immunoreactive 
    fibres in the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s194">An alternate but not mutually exclusive explanation is 
    that the immunohistochemical procedures used in the present study 
    were not sensitive enough to reveal all cholinergic fibres in the 
    SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s195">At present, the neurotransmitter content of these 
    noncholinergic projections from the PPT, LDT, and PBg regions is 
    not known.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s196">Retrogradely labelled neurons in the PBg have been 
    visualized in the cat following horseradish peroxidase injections 
    into the optic chiasm with diffusion of the tracer into the SCN 
    (Baleydier and Magnin, &apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s197">The PBg is known to innervate the contralateral superior 
    colliculus (Mufson et al., &apos;86) through a long loop which 
    ascends along the optic tract, crosses the midline in Gudden&apos;s 
    supraoptic commissure, and returns along the contralateral optic 
    tract (Graybiel, &apos;78).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s198">It is most likely that some of these fibres reach the 
    SCN at the most rostra1 level of this loop.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s199">It is, however, also possible that the labelling in the 
    PBg in the present study is, in part, due to leakage of the tracer 
    into the optic tract and its uptake by potential damaged fibres.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s200">This possibility is suggested by the observation of a 
    few retrogradely labelled cells in the superior colliculus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s201">Since the superior colliculus projects to the lateral 
    posterior nucleus of the thalamus through the supraoptic 
    commissure, the observation of retrogradely labelled cells in the 
    superior colliculus suggests that there was some leakage of the 
    tracer into the supraoptic commissure.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s202">Therefore some of the PBg neurons labelled by fluorogold 
    may be the neurons projecting to the superior colliculus via the 
    optic tracts.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s203">Anterogradely labelled fibres were observed in the SCN 
    following biocytin injections into PPT, PBg and LDT.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s204">In view of a recent report of the uptake of this tracer 
    by passing fibres (Chevalier et al., &apos;921, the possibility 
    exists that these labelled fibers in the SCN actually represented 
    fibres which passed through these brainstem regions but arose from 
    neurons whose cell bodies were located further caudally.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s205">This is particularly a concern for injections in the 
    PPT, which is located amongst various fibre tracts.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s206">Despite this caveat, however, these anterograde 
    labelling results confirm that the retrogradely labelled neurons 
    observed in these brainstem nuclei following fluorogold injections 
    into the SCN were not entirely due to the tracer being taken up by 
    damaged fibres of passage.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s207">With all three injections, thin biocytin labelled fibres 
    and terminals were observed in the entire rostrocaudal extent of 
    the SCN with the highest density being found in the ventral SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s208">Observation of labelled fibres in the basal forebrain 
    area in the cases of PPT and LDT injections and in the lateral 
    hypothalamus in the case of PPT injections are consistent with 
    previous findings (Satoh and Fibiger, &apos;86; Hallanger and 
    Wainer, &apos;88; Cornwall et al., &apos;90).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s209">Although it was not technically feasible to confirm the 
    cholinergic nature of fibres anterogradely labelled from the 
    brainstem, the presence of ChATimmunoreactive fibres in the SCN 
    combined with the retrograde and anterograde tracing data provide 
    strong support for the presence of cholinergic projections from the 
    basal forebrain and mesopontine tegmentum to the SCN.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s210">The absence of clearly double-labelled cells in the 
    retina indicates that few, if any, retinal ganglion cells 
    projecting to the SCN are cholinergic.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s211">This conclusion does not imply that cholinergic effects 
    on rhythms cannot be mediated in part via the retina, since 
    noncholinergic ganglion cells projecting to the SCN could readily 
    be influenced by connections from retinal cholinergic neurons.</S>
    <BR />

     id="s212">Cholinergic neurons in the cholinergic basal nuclear 
    complex and in the mesopontine tegmentum have been implicated in 
    the regulation of sleep and arousal (Steriade and McCarley,

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s214">These findings and the present results taken together 
    suggest that ACh released from the cholinergic neurons in the basal 
    forebrain and brainstem influence the resetting of the circadian 
    clock.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s215">The basal forebrain area containing cholinergic neurons 
    has been shown to receive retinal terminals in both hamsters and

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s216">Thus, it is possible that photic input reaching the 
    cholinergic basal nuclear complex activates these cholinergic 
    cells, resulting in the release of ACh in the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s217">This ACh could then act either directly on pacemaker 
    cells, or indirectly through interneurons that make synaptic 
    connections with pacemaker cells, to alter clock mechanisms, 
    thereby contributing to a phase shift of circadian rhythms.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s218">The new phase of the clock would be transmitted to the 
    forebrain, brainstem and thalamic nuclei involved in the generation 
    and maintenance of sleep and arousal and to autonomic nuclei, 
    presumably via polysynaptic pathways from the SCN.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s219">This model proposes a feedback loop in which neural 
    mechanisms involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness are

    processes.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    terminate on cholinergic neurons.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s221">In addition, there are no direct efferent projections 
    from the SCN to the cholinergic basal nuclear complex, to the 
    aminergic (the dorsal raphe and the locus coeruleus) and

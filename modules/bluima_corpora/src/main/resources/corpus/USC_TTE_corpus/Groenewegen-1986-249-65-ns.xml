     id="s1">The organization of afferent and efferent connections of 
    the interpeduncular nucleus (IP) has been examined in correlation 
    with its subnuclear parcellation by using anterograde and 
    retrograde tracing techniques.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s2">Based on Nissl, myelin, and acetylcholinesterase staining 
    five paired and three unpaired IP subnuclei are distinguished.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s3">The unpaired division includes the rostral subnucleus 
    UP-R), the apical subnucleus (IP-A), and the central subnucleus 
    (IP-C).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s4">The subnuclei represented bilaterally are the paramedian 
    dorsal medial (IP-DM) and intermediate subnuclei (IP-I) and the 
    laterally placed rostral lateral (IP-RL), dorsal lateral (IP-DL), 
    and lateral subnuclei (IP-L).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">Immunohistochemical techniques showed cell bodies and 
    fibers and terminals immunoreactive for substance P, 
    leu-enkephalin, met-enkephalin, or serotonin to be differentially 
    distributed over the different IP subnuclei.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s6">Substance P-positive perikarya were found in IP-R, 
    enkephalin neurons in IP-R, IP-A, and the caudodorsal part of IP-C, 
    and serotonin-containing cell bodies in IP-A and the caudal part of 
    IP-L.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s7">Efferent IP projections were studied both by injecting 
    tritiated leucine in IP and by injecting HRP or WGA-HRP in the 
    presumed termination areas.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s8">The results indicate that the major outflow of IP is 
    directed caudalward to the median and dorsal raphe nuclei and the 
    caudal part of the central gray substance, i.e., the dorsal 
    tegmental region.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s9">The projection appears to terminate mainly in the raphe 
    nuclei, around the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei of Gudden, 
    and in the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s10">The descending projection to the dorsal tegmental region 
    originates in virtually all IP subnuclei, but the main contribution 
    comes from IP-R and the lateral subnuclei IP-RL, IP-DL, and 
    IP-L.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">Sparser projections to the dorsal tegmental region 
    originate in IP-C and IP-I, whereas the contribution of IP-A is 
    only minimal.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">The projections from IP-R are mainly ipsilateral and 
    those from IP-DM are mainly contralateral.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">IP fibers to the median and dorsal raphe nuclei originate 
    predominantly in IP-R and IP-DM, and to a lesser extent in IP-C, 
    IP-I, IP-RL, and IP-DL.</S>

    &apos;83a,b).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s23">The interpeduncular nucleus constitutes an important link 
    in the descending pathways of the limbic systemmidbrain circuit 
    (Nauta, &apos;58; Herkenham and Nauta, &apos;79; Nauta and 
    Domesick, &apos;81).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s24">Limbic forebrain structures such as the septa1 region and 
    the preoptic area are connected through the medial habenular 
    nucleus to the interpeduncular nucleus (Wang and Aghajanian, 
    &apos;77; Herkenham and Nauta &apos;77, &apos;79; Marchand et al., 
    &apos;80), which itself projects prominently to the region of the 
    mesencephalic raphe nuclei.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s25">The median and dorsal raphe nuclei in turn affect all of 
    the principal subdivisions of the forebrain by way of widespread 
    serotoninergic projections that directly involve such diverse 
    structures as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the striatum, and the 
    cerebral cortex (Conrad et al., &apos;74; Bobillier et al., 
    &apos;75; Azmitia and Segal, &apos;78; Steinbusch, &apos;81).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s26">A descending projection to the mesencephalic raphe, first 
    described by Ganser in 1882, doubtless represents the most 
    substantial and well-defined efferent connection of the 
    interpeduncular nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s27">Much less is known about other efferent connections of 
    the nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s28">Older studies by the aid of fiber-degeneration methods 
    have yielded some impression of these less prominent projections 
    (Massopust and Thompson, &apos;62; Mitchell, &apos;63; Smaha and 
    Kaelber, &apos;731, but a more detailed analysis by such methods 
    has been impeded by the small size of the nucleus and its position 
    between large ascending and descending fiber tracts.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s29">Both degeneration experiments and more recent anterograde 
    (Stofer and Edwards, &apos;78) and retrograde tracer studies have 
    indicated that the interpeduncular nucleus, in addition to its 
    major descending projections, gives rise to ascending pathways as 
    well.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s30">Thus, retrogradely labeled cells have been found in the 
    interpeduncular nucleus following HRP injections into the 
    hippocampus (Baisden et al., &apos;79; Wyss et al., &apos;79; Riley 
    and Moore, &apos;811, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (Velayos and 
    Reinoso-Suarez, &apos;82; Groenewegen and Nauta, &apos;821, and the 
    lateral hypothalamus (Stofer and Edwards, &apos;78).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s31">The nucleus interpeduncularis consists of several 
    cytoarchitectonically distinct cell groups (Ives, &apos;71; Hamill 
    and Lenn, &apos;81, &apos;84; Hemmendinger and Moore, &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s32">Moreover, specific parts of the interpeduncular nucleus 
    can be distinguished from other parts by a higher or lower content 
    in substances such as acetylcholinesterase and one or the other of 
    several peptides or transmitter substances, either in fibers and 
    terminals or in cell bodies (Ljungdahl et al., &apos;78; Sar et 
    al., &apos;78; Cuello and Kanazawa, &apos;78; Steinbusch, &apos;81; 
    Finley et al., &apos;81; Hemmendinger and Moore, &apos;82, 
    &apos;84; Hamill et al., &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s33">Little is known, however, of the specific inputoutput 
    relationships of such individual parts of the nucleus.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s34">In the present study the autoradiographic fiber-tracing 
    method was used to trace the efferent connections of the 
    interpeduncular nucleus in the rat.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s35">Subsequently, the retrograde-tracing techniques were 
    employed to corroborate the results of these and previously 
    reported anterograde-tracing experiments and to determine the 
    pathways in question with respect to the cytoarchitectonically and 
    histochemically specified subdivisions of the interpeduncular 
    nucleus.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s36">The results of these experiments provided a rather 
    detailed picture of the interpeduncular afTerents, and in view of 
    this it seemed worthwhile to restudy a number of afferent fiber 
    systems of the interpeduncular nucleus with anterograde-tracing 
    techniques in an attempt to correlate the afferent and efferent 
    relationships of the nucleus.</S>

    Ives&apos;s pattern of organization of the IP implies a central

    al., &apos;84), the findings of Flumerfelt and Contestabile

    topographical organization in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway: 
    the ventral part of the medial habenula, for example, is known to 
    project to the medial IP and the medial part of the medial habenula 
    to ventral portions of the IP (Herkenham and Nauta, &apos;79;

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    must be considered that the close colocalization of AChE with

    structures.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s617">On the basis of current data the interpeduncular nucleus 
    (IP) can be viewed first and foremost as a highly differentiated 
    processing station placed in the path of the fasciculus 
    retroflexus, the route from the habenular complex to the median 
    raphe nucleus (MRN) and to the dorsal tegmental region (DTR, 
    encompassing the dorsal raphe nucleus, the tegmental nuclei of 
    Gudden, and the nucleus tegmenti dorsalis lateralis).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s618">From a functional point of view it may be significant 
    that the interpeduncular nucleus almost selectively interrupts, 
    apparently with all its subdivisions, t hat component of the 
    fasciculus retroflexus that originates from the medial habenular 
    nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s619">Since the medial habenular nucleus in turn is innervated 
    very largely by cell groups of the supraand retrocommissural 
    septum, and appears to receive few if any afferents from its 
    immediate neighbor, the lateral habenular nucleus (cf.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s620">Herkenham and Nauta, &apos;77, &apos;791, it seems 
    likely that the habenulo-interpeduncular connection conveys 
    information of predominantly hippocampal antecedents.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s621">The lateral habenular nucleus is innervated by a greater 
    diversity of forebrain sites, but its substantial contribution to 
    the fasciculus retroflexus largely (if perhaps not entirely) 
    bypasses the interpeduncular nucleus and is distributed mainly to 
    the median raphe nucleus and dorsal tegmental region (Herkenham and 
    Nauta, &apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s622">It is nonetheless likely that the lateral habenular 
    nucleus can modulate the mechanisms of the interpeduncular nucleus 
    at least indirectly by way of the voluminous (and reciprocated) 
    projection from the MRN and DTR that provides the IP with what 
    appears to be its second-most massive input.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s623">Like the habenulo-interpeduncular tract, this projection 
    appears to involve all of the currently recognized subdivisions of 
    the IP.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s624">To what extent (and to what effect) these two main 
    aKerent systems interact with each other at the level of the YP 
    appears to be an unexplored question.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s625">Thus far, only the integral effect of habenula 
    stimulation on the activity of single IP units appears to have been 
    examined, apparently without systematic attempts to differentiate 
    between afferent conduction directly from the habenula by the 
    habenulointerpeduncular tract, or indirectly by way of the dorsal 
    tegmental region.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s626">In such studies both Lake (&apos;73) and Sastry ( 78) 
    found the effect of habenula stimulation upon single IP units to be 
    predominantly excitatory.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s627">Both these authors reported, moreover, that most (more 
    than 80% according to Lake) of the IP units recorded from, whether 
    facilitated or inhibited by habenula stimulation, were excited by 
    acetylcholine delivered by microiontophoresis; Sastry found this is 
    true also of substance P, the second neural messenger identified in 
    the habenulo-interpeduncular tract.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s628">No similar studies examining the effects of electrical 
    stimulation of the dorsal tegmental region upon IP units have come 
    to OUT attention; such studies presumably would be complicated by 
    the fact that the projection to the IP from the DTR, in contrast to 
    that from the habenula, is heavily reciprocated.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s629">The largely excitatory effect of habenula stimulation 
    upon IP newons is remarkable in view of Wang and Aghajanian s 1 77) 
    finding that such stimulation has a strongly inhibitory effect on 
    serotonin neurons, at least in the dorsal raphe region.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s630">Wang and Aghajanian found this inhibition to be blocked 
    by iontophoretically delivered picrotoxin, and therefore suggested 
    that it is transmitted by GABAergic fibers.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s631">Whether the effect in the raphe nuclei is mediated 
    directly by the lateral habenular nucleus as Wang and Aghajanian 
    suggested or by intrinsic GABA neurons in the raphe nuclei proper 
    (McGeer et al., 79) must for the present remain an open 
    question.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s632">From the observations of Maciewicz et al. ( 81) it 
    appears that in the cat the entire population of raphe neurons is 
    not inhibited by habenula stimulation but rather that a separate 
    group receives an excitatory input from the IP.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s633">Whether the cells of origin of this IP projection in 
    turn are influenced by the excitatory input from the habenula is, 
    as yet, unknown.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s634">In any case, an active involvement of the 
    interpeduncular nucleus in the mechanisms of inhibition, and 
    facilitation of the serotonin innervation of the forebrain seems a 
    distinct possibility.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s635">It is difficult to correlate these findings at the 
    single-unit level with the organismic aspects of 
    interpeduncular-nucleus function.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s636">In view of its placement in the brain s circuitry it 
    seems safe to assume that the IP is involved in some, at bast, of 
    the functions attributed to the dorsal diencephalic conduction 
    system (Sutherland, 82) descending from the forebrain to the 
    mesencephalon by way of the habenular complex.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s637">Not surprisingly, a wide-ranging and in part quite 
    controversial literature recently reviewed by Sutherland ( 82) 
    indicated that these functions affect endocrine (in particular 
    thyroid) and autonomic (respiratory, cardivascular, and intestinal) 
    as well as general behavioral mechanisms such as mating behavior, 
    avoidance response, and intracranial self-stimulation.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s638">Judged by the great 1011gitudinal spread of its 
    efferents, the IP would Seem capable of exerting an effect on these 
    phenomena both at the level of the hippocampand throughout the 
    extent Of the SePtohypothalamo-mesencephalic cOntinUUm (Nauta and 
    Domesick, 81) implicated in the subcortical circuitry of the Iimbic

     id="s1">The present study was undertaken to establish the precise 
    anatomical relationship of the subthalamic nucleus (STh) with 
    limbic lobe-afferented parts of the basal ganglia in the rat.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s2">The anterograde tracer Phaseolus uulgaris-leucoagglutinin 
    (PHA-L), injected in the STh, the globus pallidus, the ventral 
    pallidum, the ventral striatum, and the parafascicular thalamic 
    nucleus, and the retrograde tracers Fluoro-Gold (FG) and cholera 
    toxin B (CTb), injected in the globus pallidus, the ventral 
    pallidum, the ventral striatum, and the ventral mesencephalon, were 
    used for this purpose.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s3">The results of these tracing experiments confirm the 
    general notion of reciprocal connections between the STh and 
    pallidal areas.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s4">Thus the dorsomedial part of the STh is connected with the 
    subcommisural ventral pallidum, whereas a more ventral and lateral 
    part of the medial STh is related to the medial globus pallidus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">The lateral hypothalamic area, directly adjacent to the 
    STh, containing neurons with a morphology quite similar to those in 
    the STh, projects to parts of the ventral pallidum related to the 
    olfactory tubercle.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s6">The reciprocal projection from this pallidal area to 
    subthalamic regions appears to be very sparse.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s7">The medial STh sends strong projections to the medial part 
    of the entopeduncular nucleus and the adjacent lateral hypothalamic 
    area.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s8">Sparser projections from the medial STh reach the rostra1 
    and medial part of the caudate-putamen and the nucleus 
    accumbens.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s9">The nucleus accumbens sends a very sparse projection back 
    to the medial STh.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s10">The projections of the medial STh to the ventral 
    mesencephalon appear also to be topographically organized.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">The lateral hypothalamus and a few cells in the most 
    medial part of the STh project to the ventral tegmental area, 
    whereas progressively more lateral parts of the ventral 
    mesencephalon, in particular the substantia nigra, receive input 
    from successively more lateral and caudal parts of the STh.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">In addition, a number of STh fibers reach the midbrain 
    extrapyramidal area.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">The lateral part of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus 
    projects to the lateral part of the STh, whereas parafascicular 
    neurons medial to the fasciculus retroflexus project to the 
    dorsomedial portion of the STh.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s14">The medial part of the STh and the adjacent lateral 
    hypothalamus are intimately connected with limbic parts of the 
    basal ganglia in a way similar and parallel to the connections of 
    the lateral STh with motor-related parts of the basal ganglia.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s15">These findings suggest a role for the STh in nonmotor 
    functions of the basal ganglia.</S>

  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s16">The subthalamic nucleus (STh), a small nuclear mass 
    located just dorsal to the cerebral peduncle in the caudal part of 
    the diencephalon, is generally considered to be part of the motor 
    system.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s17">Dysfunctioning of this nucleus can lead to a hyperkinetic 
    syndrome that is known as (hemi)ballism.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s18">Although there are some species differences, in all 
    mammals studied the main projections from the STh reach the 
    external and internal (entopeduncular nucleus in cats and rodents) 
    segments of the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, and the 
    pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (Nauta and Cole, &apos;78; 
    Ricardo, &apos;80; Carpenter et al., &apos;81; Jackson and 
    Crossman, &apos;81, &apos;83; Kita and Kitai, &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s19">In turn, the STh receives fibers predominantly from the 
    external segment of the globus pallidus and the motor cortex 
    (Kunzle and Akert, &apos;77; Kunzle, &apos;78; Hartmann-Von Monakow 
    et al., &apos;79; Carpenter et al., &apos;81; Afsharpour, &apos;85) 
    and to a lesser degree from the parafascicular thalamic nucleus 
    (Sugimoto et al., &apos;83; Sugimot0 and Hattori, &apos;83) and the 
    pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (Graybiel, &apos;77; Nomura et 
    al., &apos;80; Carpenter et al., &apos;81; Hammond et al., 
    &apos;83).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s20">In the 1980s it became increasingly clear that extensive 
    parts of the basal ganglia are involved in the processing of 
    information from limbic structures, in particular the hippocampus 
    and the amygdala (Heimer and Wilson, &apos;75).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s21">The connectional organization of these limbic 
    lobe-afferented parts of the basal ganglia largely parallels the 
    circuitry of the rest of the basal ganglia (Haber et al., 
    &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s22">In the rat, it has been shown that the limbic striatum 
    encompasses the nucleus accumbens, the striatal elements of the 
    olfactory tubercle, and the ventromedial and caudal parts of the 
    caudate-putamen.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s23">This designation is primarily based on the distribution 
    in the ventral striatum of inputs from the hippocampus, the 
    amygdala, and limbic diencephalic and mesencephalic structures 
    (Heimer and Wilson, &apos;75; Groenewegen et al., &apos;82, 
    &apos;87; Nauta, &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s24">The efferent connections of the ventral striatum are 
    distributed to pallidal structures that occupy the medial region of 
    the main body of the globus pallidus and an adjacent area 
    underneath the anterior commissure that has been designated as the 
    ventral pallidum (Heimer and Wilson, &apos;75; Nauta et al., 
    &apos;78; Haber and Nauta, &apos;83).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s25">The latter area encompasses a region directly ventral to 
    the anterior commissure, i.e., the subcommissural part of the 
    ventral pallidum, and fingerlike rostra1 extensions of this region 
    into the deep layers of the olfactory tubercle.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s26">Like its dorsal, nonlimbic counterpart, the ventral 
    pallidum sends fibers to the thalamus, the ventral mesencephalon, 
    and the STh (Haber et al., &apos;85; Nauta, &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s27">The projection from the ventral part of the pallidal 
    complex to the STh has been considered as a route by which ventral 
    striatopallidal pathways reach the motor system (Nauta, 
    &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s28">Apart from the ventral pallidal input to the STh, very 
    little is known about any further relations of this nucleus with 
    the limbic lobe-innervated parts of the basal ganglia.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s29">Recently, it has been shown that the primate STh is a 
    rather differentiated structure with respect to its afferent and 
    efferent connections and that functionally different subsectors may 
    exist (e.g., Parent and Smith, &apos;87).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s30">The main purpose of the present study in the rat was to 
    establish the exact anatomical relationship of the STh with limbic 
    lobe-related parts of the basal ganglia and the midbrain 
    tegmentum.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s31">Therefore, injections of anterograde tracers were placed 
    in the STh, the ventral striatum, the globus pallidus, and the 
    ventral pallidum.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s32">Retrograde tracers were injected in the ventral tegmental 
    area and the adjacent substantia nigra and in the globus pallidus, 
    the ventral pallidum, and the ventral striatum.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s33">Additional data were obtained from injections of 
    anterograde tracers in the caudal thalamus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s34">The results of our experiments show that the medial 
    portion of the STh and the directly adjacent region of the lateral 
    hypothalamus are intricately connected with parts of the basal 
    ganglia that project to and receive inputs from limbic structures, 
    i.e., the ventral pallidum, the olfactory tubercle, and the ventral 
    tegmental area.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s35">This may imply that, apart from its prevalent motor role, 
    the STh is also involved in the processing of limbic 
    information.</S>

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    Figure 8.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s157">Combining the results of the anterograde and retrograde 
    tracing experiments, it can be concluded that the dorsomedial part 
    of the STh has strong reciprocal connections with the 
    subcommissural part of the ventral pallidum.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s158">The same part of the STh sends weaker projections to the 
    ventral tegmental area and adjacent parts of the substantia nigra 
    and to a more caudal midbrain region, i.e., the midbrain 
    extrapyramidal area (Rye et al., &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s159">It further receives thalamic inputs from the medial part 
    of the parafascicular nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s160">The region of the medial STh, directly ventral and 
    lateral to the above-mentioned dorsomedial portion of the STh, is 
    reciprocally connected with the medial part of the main body of the 
    glohus pallidus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s161">Projections from more lateral parts of the STh terminate 
    more laterally and ventrally in the substantia nigra than those 
    from the medial part and, like the latter, also extend into the 
    midbrain extrapyramidal area (Fig. 8).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s162">The results of the PHA-L anterograde tracing experiments 
    show that the medial STh has additional projections to the medial 
    part of the entopeduncular nucleus and the directly adjacent region 
    of the lateral hypothalamic area and to a lateral and ventral zone 
    of the globus pallidus.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s164">Finally, the lateral hypothalamic region medially

    elements of the olfactory tubercle.</S>

     id="s167">The advantages and limitations of the use of Phaseolus 
    uulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) have been amply discussed in the 
    literature (Gerfen and Sawchenko, &apos;84; Groenewegen and 
    Wouterlood, &apos;90).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s168">Choleratoxin subunit B (CTb) has been introduced only 
    recently as a retrograde neuroanatomical tracer (Ericson and 
    Blomqvist, &apos;88) and therefore deserves some discussion.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s169">Choleratoxin B is transported both anterogradely and 
    retrogradely, but the anterograde transport is generally weaker and 
    in its quality of labeling neuronal structures is not comparable 
    with PHA-L.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s170">The main advantage of CTb as a retrograde tracer is its 
    superior sensitivity and the excellent retrograde filling of the 
    dendritic arborizations (Ericson and Rlomqvist, &apos;88).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s171">In the present study the very weak projections from the 
    STh to the striatum could indeed be shown with CTh.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s172">The main disadvantages of the CTb technique are that the 
    dimensions of the injection site are difficult to control and that 
    the tracer is taken up by passing fibers.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s173">However, both problems do not affect the interpretation 
    of the results of the present experiments in which CTb was used.</S>

    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s175">The results of previous studies have shown that the most 
    prominent fiber connections of the STh are established with 
    pallidal structures (e.g., Nauta and Cole, &apos;78; Ricardo, 
    &apos;80; Carpenter et al., &apos;81; Kita and Kitai, &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s176">In concurrence with these studies, the present data 
    indicate that the densest projections from the medial STh reach the 
    ventral pallidum and the medial part of the entopeduncular 
    nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s177">Furthermore, the lateral hypothalamic area medially 
    adjacent to the entopeduncular nucleus receives an even denser 
    termination from the medial STh than the entopeduncular nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s178">This finding underscores the previously expressed notion 
    that this area is continuous with and, in its connectivity, very 
    similar to the entopeduncular nucleus (cf.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s179">Heimer et al., &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s180">Like the entopeduncular nucleus, neurons in this region 
    of the lateral hypothalamus project to the lateral habenula 
    (Herkenham and Nauta, &apos;77).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s181">The same hypothalamic region receives input also from 
    the ventral striatum and has immunohistochemical characteristics 
    comparable to those of the entopeduncular nucleus (Nauta et al., 
    &apos;78; Groenewegen and Russchen, &apos;84; Haber et al., 
    &apos;90).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s182">The present findings of a projection from the medial STh 
    to the lateral hypothalamus adjacent to the entopeduncular nucleus 
    further confirms the internal pallidal nature of this area.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s183">Whether the latter region indeed represents the internal 
    segment of the limbic-related ventral pallidum cannot be concluded 
    only from the existing evidence.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s184">Physiological and behavioral data are needed to further 
    explore this possibility.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s185">It is also important to note here that the 
    subcommissural ventral or limbic pallidum has a number of 
    characteristics that resemble those of both the internal and 
    external segments of the globus pallidus (cf.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s186">Heimer et al., 85; Nauta, 86).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s187">Therefore, it is unclear whether a separation in 
    internal and external segments can be made within the 
    limbic-related parts of the pallidal complex, as in the dorsally 
    located globus pallidus.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s188">The present results indicate that there is a rather 
    strict topography in the reciprocal pallidosubthalamic connections 
    involving the medial STh.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s189">In particular, the results of the anterograde (PHA-L) 
    and retrograde tracer injections in the subcommissural part of the 
    ventral pallidum and of those in the medial sector of the globus 
    pallidus show that these distinct parts of the pallidal complex 
    communicate with distinct parts of the medial STh (Fig. 8).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s190">As a result of the circumstance that following the 
    injections of PHA-L in the STh pallidal neurons are retrogradely 
    labeled, it was observed that anterogradely labeled 
    subthalamopallidal fibers make close contact with these 
    retrogradely labeled pallidal cells or with their dendrites.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s191">This emphasizes the reciprocity of the connections.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s192">The fact that injections of PHA-L in the olfactory 
    tubercle, in which large pallidal neurons are included, give rise 
    to anterograde labeling of fibers and terminals in the lateral 
    hypothalamic area adjacent to the STh and that injections of 
    retrograde tracers in the olfactory tubercle result in labeled 
    neurons in the same hypothalamic region, concurs with the 
    reciprocity in the pallidosubthalamic connections.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s193">This implies that a population of neurons outside the 
    borders of the STh have connectional characteristics comparable to 
    those of subthalamic neurons.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s194">An argument in favor of the notion that neurons lying 
    outside the STh proper belong to the same neuronal system is the 
    similarity in morphology of the retrogradely labeled neurons in the 
    lateral hypothalamus at the level of the STh following olfactory 
    tubercle injections and the retrogradely labeled cells in the STh 
    after injections in the ventral pallidum (cf. also Kita et al., 
    83).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s195">A difference is that in the STh the neurons are more 
    closely packed.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s196">Furthermore, it is of interest to note that a small 
    number of subthalamic cells projecting to the globus pallidus are 
    situated amidst the fiber bundles of the cerebral peduncle, and 
    therefore also lie outside the borders of the STh.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s197">Whether the lateral hypothalamic neurons close to the 
    STh may indeed be considered subthalamic neurons awaits further 
    knowledge of the synaptology and the physiological characteristics 
    of these cells.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s198">Seemingly in contrast with the above-discussed 
    topography in the pallidosubthalamic connections is the finding 
    that PHA-L injections in the medial STh result in a rather 
    widespread anterograde labeling in the pallidal complex.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s199">However, this is probably due to the fact that even when 
    PHA-L is used as the tracer, the injection sites in a small nucleus 
    such as the STh are relatively large.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s200">Another observation that bears discussion is the 
    presently observed projection from the medial part of the STh to a 
    strip in the ventral and lateral parts of the globus pallidus at 
    the border with the caudate-putamen complex.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s201">A lateral strip of subthalamic terminals in the globus 
    pallidus has also been reported by Kita and Kitai (&apos;87) 
    following lateral injections in STh.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s202">As suggested by these authors, inputs from all parts of 
    the STh might converge in this lateral band of the globus pallidus, 
    whereas the subthalamopallidal fibers to more medial parts of the 
    pallidal complex are topographically organized (as discussed 
    above).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s203">The striatopallidal projection system has also been 
    shown, on the one hand, to be highly topographically organized and, 
    on the other, to contain a nontopographical component, such that 
    divergent areas of the striatum project in an overlapping manner to 
    a lateral strip of the globus pallidus bordering the caudateputamen 
    complex (Chang et al., &apos;81; Wilson and Phelan, &apos;82; 
    Gerfen, &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s204">Presumably, the lateral strip of subthalamic projections 
    in the globus pallidus overlaps with these nontopographically 
    organized striatopallidal projections.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s205">Not only in the rat, but also in the primate a banded 
    organization of the subthalamopallidal projections has been 
    described (Nauta and Cole, &apos;78; Parent et al., &apos;89).</S>

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s208">The fibers originate in the medial part of the STh and

    caudate-putamen complex and in the lateral part of the nucleus 
    accumbens.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    the results of injections of the sensitive tracer CTb.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s210">Apparently, it is modest in volume since following 
    injections of this tracer in the ventral striatum the number of 
    retrogradely neurons in the STh is very small and the cells are 
    only weakly labeled even though the injections are relatively 
    large.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s211">The results obtained from a large collection of PHA-L 
    tracing experiments with injections of the tracer in the ventral 
    striatum indicate that the connection from the STh to this part of 
    the striatum is reciprocated.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s212">As judged from the number of fibers that enter the STh

    pathway is also not extensive in the rat.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    reciprocal connection between the STh and the striatum does exist 
    in the rat, this pathway is much less prevalent than in cats and 
    monkeys (rat: Kita and Kitai, &apos;87; present study; cat:

     id="s224">Whereas Ricardo (&apos;80) showed that injections of 
    tritiated amino acids in lateral parts of the STh give rise to 
    anterograde labeling ventrally in the pars reticulata, close to the 
    cerebral peduncle, the present results show that the projections 
    from the medial STh reach more dorsal strata of the pars 
    reticulata, close to the pars compacta.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s225">It thus appears that in these projections a mediolateral 
    axis in the STh corresponds to a dorsoventral axis in the 
    substantia nigra (cf. also Kita and Kitai, &apos;87).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    (Ricardo, &apos;80; Mintz et al., &apos;86; Kita and Kitai, 
    &apos;87), our results also show that the pars compacta of the 
    substantia nigra receives an input from the STh.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s227">In line with the above-discussed involvement of the 
    medial STh in limbicrelated circuits, additional projections from 
    this part of the nucleus are directed to the limbic-related ventral 
    tegmental area.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s228">It is therefore possible that the medial part of the 
    STh, through its projections to the dopaminergic cells in the 
    ventral tegmental area and the adjacent pars compacta of the 
    substantia nigra influences the ascending mesolimbic dopamine 
    pathways, which, among others, distribute to the ventral 
    striatum.</S>

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    Russchen, &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

     id="s239">A second system of striatopallidosubthalamic connections 
    is formed by the projections from the ventromedial part of the 
    caudato-putamen to the medial parts of the globus pallidus (Gerfen, 
    &apos;85) and the entopeduncular nucleus (unpublished observations)

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    connections with the latter two regions comprises the lateral 
    two-thirds of the nucleus (Ricardo, &apos;80; Kita and Kitai,

    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s242">As first documented by Nauta and Domesick (&apos;79) and 
    Domesick (&apos;81)&apos; the organization in the projections from 
    the striatum to the substantia nigra is such that ventral regions 
    of the striatum, including the nucleus accumhens, project to dorsal 
    zones of the substantia nigra, whereas dorsal regions of the 
    striatum project to ventral zones of the substantia nigra.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s243">In the present study it was found that the projections

    axis in the substantia nigra.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s244">Because, as discussed above, the medial and lateral 
    parts of the STh are related to ventral and dorsal regions of the 
    striatum, respectively, this means that the topography in the 
    subthalamonigral fibers is in register with that in the 
    striatonigral projections (see also Kita and Kitai, &apos;87).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s245">A further interesting feature is that the projections of 
    the lateral and medial parts of the thalamic parafascicular nucleus 
    to the striatum and STh terminate in areas that are mutually 
    interconnected, either directly or by way of the pallidal 
    complex.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s246">The areas that are targeted by the fibers from the 
    lateral parts of the parafascicular nucleus are the dorsolateral 
    region of the caudate-putamen and the lateral STh, whereas the 
    medial part of the parafascicular nucleus distributes its fibers to 
    the medial region of the caudateputamen, the lateral part of the

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s251">This may indicate that the dorsomedial STh is innervated

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

     id="s255">The role of the subthalamic nucleus (STh) in behavior is 
    thought to be primarily in the realm of the motor system.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s256">This suggestion is based on the intimate anatomical 
    relationship of the STh with primarily motor-related parts of the 
    basal ganglia and with the motor cortex, and concurs with 
    experimental and clinical observations that lesions or 
    pharmacological manipulations of the STh result in pronounced motor 
    disturbances, i.e., (hemi)ballistic symptoms (Martin, &apos;27; 
    Whittier and Mettler, &apos;49; Carpenter et al., &apos;50; 
    Crossman, &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s257">However, the present and previous (Ricardo, &apos;80; 
    Haber et al., &apos;85; Kita and Kitai, &apos;87) anatomical 
    tracing studies have provided evidence that the STh also has 
    connections with the ventral pallidum, which through projections 
    from the ventral striatum is under the influence of limbic 
    structures.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s258">Moreover, it could presently be shown that the medial 
    STh has additional connections with other limbic-innervated parts 
    of the basal ganglia, such as the ventral tegmental area, the 
    lateral hypothalamus at the level of the entopeduncular nucleus, 
    and the ventral striatum.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s259">Our results further indicate that the connections of the 
    lateral hypothalamus directly medial to the STh has characteristics 
    very similar to those of the STh itself.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s260">The conclusion that the medial STh is intricately 
    connected with the ventral striatopallidal parts of the basal 
    ganglia is important since, contrary to earlier reports that the 
    subthalamic output is inhibitory and GABAergic (Rouzaire-Dubois et 
    al., &apos;83), it has now been demonstrated that the projections 
    of the STh to the pallidal complex and the substantia nigra are 
    excitatory and presumably use glutamate as neurotransmitter (Kitai 
    and Kita, &apos;87; Smith and Parent, &apos;88; Albin et al., 
    &apos;89).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s261">The subthalamic input to the ventral pallidum might 
    therefore be an important driving force of this part of the 
    pallidal complex.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s262">The present findings and the results of previous studies 
    on the connections of the STh with the caudate nucleus of the 
    primate (Parent and Smith, &apos;87) indicate that functions of the 
    STh are probably not restricted to the motor system, but also 
    include the limbic and cognitive spheres of the brain.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s263">The rather precise topographical arrangements in the 
    connections of the STh with other parts of the basal ganglia might 
    imply that the influence of a certain part of the STh remains 
    restricted to those subdivisions of the striatopallidal system from 
    which it receives its inputs.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s264">Thus, judged purely on the basis of its connections, the 
    involvement of the STh in limbic-motor integration is rather 
    limited.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s265">However, the projections from the medial STh to a 
    lateral band of the globus pallidus may yet provide a way for 
    limbic influences to reach the somatomotor system through the 
    subthalamic nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s266">In addition, the STh projections to the medial part of 
    the globus pallidus and the medially adjacent region of the 
    internal capsule may contact the numerous cholinergic neurons in 
    this region (Mesulam, &apos;83) that project to the prefrontal and 
    motor cortices (Saper, &apos;84; Luiten et al., &apos;87).</S>

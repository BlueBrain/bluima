     id="s1">The prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to the basal 
    forebrain cholinergic cell groups in the medial septum (MS), 
    vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB 
    and HDB), and the magnocellular basal nucleus (MBN) in the rat were 
    investigated by anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris 
    leuco-agglutinin (PHA-L) combined with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
    histochemistry or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) 
    immunocytochemistry.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s2">The experiments revealed rich PHA-Glabeled projections to 
    discrete parts of the basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFChS) 
    essentially originating from all prefrontal areas investigated.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s3">The PFC afTerents to the BFChS display a topographic 
    organization, such that medial prefrontal areas project to the MS, 
    VDB, and the medial part of the HDB, whereas the orbital and 
    agranular insular areas predominantly innervate the HDB and MBN, 
    respectively.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s4">Since the recurrent BFChS projection to the prefrontal 
    cortex is arranged according to a similar topography, the 
    relationship between the BFChS and the prefrontal cortex is 
    characterized by reciprocal connections.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">Furthermore, tracer injections in the PFC resulted in 
    anterograde labeling of numerous &quot;en passant&quot; and 
    terminal boutons apposing perikarya and proximal dendrites of 
    neurons in the basal forebrain, which were stained for the 
    cholinergic marker enzymes.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s6">These results indicate that prefrontal cortical afferents 
    make direct synaptic contacts upon the cholinergic neurons in the 
    basal forebrain, although further analysis at the electron 
    microscopic level will be needed to provide conclusive evidence.</S>

  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s7">The mammalian basal forebrain contains a continuous string 
    of magnocellular cholinergic neurons being the major source of 
    cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, 
    amygdala, and olfactory bulb.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s8">In the rodent brain, accumulations of these cholinergic 
    neurons are present in the medial septum (MS) and the nuclei of the 
    diagonal band of Broca (DB), forming the rostra1 portion of the 
    basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFChS).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s9">More caudally, the cholinergic neurons are distributed 
    throughout the ventral pallidum (W), substantia innominata (SI), 
    and the ventral, medial, and caudal segments of the globus pallidus 
    (GP), collectively termed the magnocellular basal nucleus (MBN) 
    (Sofroniew et al., &apos;82; Mesulam et al., &apos;83b; Cuello and 
    Sofroniew, &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s10">In the primate brain, the main bulk of the magnocellular, 
    cortically projecting, cholinergic neurons are aggregated in the 
    infrapallidal basal nucleus of Meynert (Mesulam et al., &apos;83a; 
    Saper and Chelimsky, &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">Considerable knowledge has been gained on the overall 
    topography of the cortical projections of the BFChS by using 
    retrograde and anterograde tracing with horseradish peroxidase or 
    tritiated amino acids (Mesulam et al., &apos;83a,b; Lamour et al., 
    &apos;84; Rye et al., &apos;84; Saper, &apos;84; Woolf et al., 
    &apos;84).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">Furthermore, detailed information on the topographic 
    arrangement of the basal forebrain-cortical/hippocampal projection, 
    and on the patterns of termination in the cortex and hippocampus, 
    was obtained with anterograde tracing of the rat BFChS by using the 
    plant lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leuco-agglutinin (PHA-L) (Luiten et 
    al., &apos;85, &apos;87; Nyakas et al., &apos;87; Gaykema et al., 
    &apos;90).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">Next to the wealth of data on the efferent connections of 
    the BFChS, a flow of information on the sources of afferent input 
    to the cholinergic neurons has started to emerge.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s14">Axonal transport studies in several animal species have 
    provided information on projections from a number of brain areas 
    that terminate in the cholinergic cell areas in the basal 
    forebrain.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s15">Summarizing these results, it can be concluded that the 
    BFChS receives input from brainstem monoaminergic systems (Semba et 
    al., &apos;88; Vertes et al., &apos;88; Jones and Cuello, &apos;89) 
    but also from cortical, hippocampal, and amygdaloid regions (Jones 
    et al., &apos;76; Lemann and Saper, &apos;85; Mesulam and Mufson 
    &apos;84; Russchen et al., &apos;85; Irle and Markowitsch, 
    &apos;86; Aggleton et al., &apos;871, and in turn relays this 
    information flow to the cortical mantle via the cholinergic 
    projection.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s16">The cortical relationship of the forebrain cholinergic 
    projection neurons is therefore most likely not limited to its 
    efferent projections but is also determined by a recurrent cortical 
    afferent input.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s17">Ample evidence has been gained that the cortical input to 
    the BFChS particularly arises from several limbic and paralimbic 
    cortices based on studies in rodents (Lemann and Saper, &apos;85), 
    carnivores, and primates (Mesulam and Mufson, &apos;84; Russchen et 
    al., &apos;85; Irle and Markowitsch, &apos;86; Aggleton et al., 
    &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s18">These findings are also essential for our understanding 
    of the involvement of the BFChS in neurodegenerative processes and 
    the deficiencies in information processing in Alzheimer&apos;s 
    disease.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s19">This disease is consistently characterized by a severely 
    decreased cortical cholinergic innervation and a concomitant 
    degeneration of neurons within the basal nucleus of Meynert 
    (Whitehouse et al., &apos;82; Coyle et al., &apos;83; Saper et al., 
    &apos;85) and by the development of neuritic plaques and 
    neurofibrillary tangles in particular within the limbic and 
    paralimbic cortices (Hyman et al., &apos;84; Pearson et al., 
    &apos;85; Rogers and Morrison, &apos;85).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s20">The aim of the present investigation is therefore to 
    examine the organization of the cortical feedback to the BFChS in 
    more detail.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s21">In this work we focussed on the overall distribution of 
    the limbic prefrontal cortical projections to the basal forebrain 
    using the PHA-L anterograde tracing method (Gerfen and Sawchenko, 
    &apos;84) in combination with staining of the cholinergic cells by 
    acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pharmacohistochemistry or choline 
    acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry at the light 
    microscopic level.</S>

    the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons by the prefrontal cortex 
    but will require additional electron microscopic analysis to 
    provide conclusive evidence for a monosynaptic connection.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s214">Applying similar techniques, Zaborszky and Cullinan 
    (&apos;89) recently demonstrated a monosynaptic relationship 
    between the lateral hypothalamus and the cholinergic cells in the 
    substantia innominata at the ultrastructural level.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s215">The cortical input to the cholinergic cell body regions 
    of the basal forebrain originates mainly from layer V pyramidal 
    neurons (Russchen et d., &apos;851, which most likely utilize 
    excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) as neurotransmitters 
    (Streit, &apos;84; Campistron et al., &apos;86; Conti et al., 
    &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s216">There is biochemical evidence indeed for a glutamatergic 
    innervation of the septal and diagonal band nuclei (Walaas and 
    Fonnum, &apos;81), ventral pallidum (Fuller et al., &apos;85), and 
    the SINBN region (Davies et al., &apos;841, substantiated by 
    pharmacological evidence for the presence of glutamate receptors in 
    the magnocellular cholinergic neurons (Wood, &apos;86).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s217">The sources of glutamatergic/aspartatergic fierents have 
    only partly been revealed and may originate in other cortical areas 
    than the PFC as well, e.g., the prepiriform, entorhinal, and 
    temporal areas, which were identified as sources of input to the 
    region of the basal nucleus of Meynert in the monkey (Mesulam and 
    Mufson, &apos;84; Russchen et al., &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s218">Furthermore, Irle and Markowitsch (&apos;86) described a 
    periamygdaloid and perirhinal cortex projection to the SIDIBN 
    region in the cat and monkey.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s219">In the monkey, the medial septal and diagonal band 
    nuclei have previously been reported to receive afferents from the 
    hippocampal region (Mesulam and Mufson, &apos;84; Aggleton et al., 
    &apos;87), which also has appeared to be the case in the rat 
    (Gaykema et al., &apos;89; &apos;91).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s220">In addition to discrete regions of the cortex, also 
    cells in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala provide 
    efferents to the basal forebrain in various mammalian species 
    (Krettek and Price, &apos;78; Price and Amaral, &apos;81; Zaborszky 
    et al., &apos;84; Russchen et al., &apos;85; Irle and Markowitsch, 
    &apos;86; Aggleton et al., &apos;87).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s221">It was previously suggested that the cholinergic neurons 
    in the rat basal forebrain receive input from all cortical areas 
    (Saper, &apos;84; Lemann and Saper, &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s222">This suggestion was based on cortical injections of 
    WGA-HRP resulting in anterograde axonal and retrograde soma 
    labeling in the BFChS.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s223">No direct projections from any of the frontal, parietal, 
    temporal, or occipital neocortical areas to the BFChS were, 
    however, found using PHA-L as an anterograde tracer (Gaykema and 
    Van Eden, in preparation).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s224">Although these findings are not in line with 
    Saper&apos;s descriptions (&apos;841, they are in accordance with 
    the data obtained in primates (for review: Uylings and Van Eden, 
    &apos;90).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s225">The PFC including the anterior cingulate cortex, 
    therefore, maintains an unique position with regard to its efferent 
    (and reciprocal) connections with the BFChS.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s226">The present study provides evidence for an anatomical 
    substrate of a direct and topographically differentiated prefrontal 
    cortical influence on the basal forebrain regions and in particular 
    their cholinergic neurons.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s227">Part of the prefrontal control on the cholinergic cells 
    in the basal forebrain, and thus on the recurrent cholinergic 
    projection to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and 
    amygdala, may be exerted through a direct monosynaptic loop.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s228">The unique prefrontal cortex-basal forebrain 
    relationship as outlined in the present study may be an important 
    link in the complex circuitry involved in cognition.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s229">To date, the other limbic and associational cortical 
    feedback projections to the cholinergic basal forebrain regions 
    have not yet been systematically investigated.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s230">Detailed knowledge on these projections may further add 
    to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the 
    cognitive decline in conditions like Alzheimer&apos;s disease that 
    are probably transmitted through neuronal connections (Saper et 
    al., &apos;87; Pearson and Powell, &apos;89), and in which the 
    prefrontal and other association and limbic cortical areas, and the 
    basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, have strongly been 
    implicated.</S>

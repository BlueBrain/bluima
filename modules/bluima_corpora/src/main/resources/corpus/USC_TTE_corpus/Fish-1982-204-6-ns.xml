     id="s1">The intercollicular pathway of the hamster was studied by

     id="s4">Of the cells labeled by our injections, 18.2% were located 
    in the superficial collicular laminae (stratum griseum superficiale

    layers.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">A wide variety of morphological cell types contributed 
    axons to the intercollicular projection, and in a given animal the 
    loci of the labeled neurons were generally symmetrical with the

     id="s8">Experiments in which collicular HRP deposits were combined 
    with large cervical spinal or pontine reticular injections of 
    Nuclear Yellow indicated that intertectal neurons did not, in most 
    cases, contribute axon branches to the spinal or pontine reticular 
    projections of the colliculus.</S>

     id="s9">Receptive field data obtained at the time of the HRP 
    and/or [3H]leucine deposits demonstrated that the collicular 
    representations of the ipsilateral and at least 45&quot; of the 
    contralateral hemifields were encompassed by intercollicular 
    connections.</S>

  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">In 1966 Sprague demonstrated that removal of the 
    posterior neocortex in cat resulted in a profound contralateral 
    hemianopsia which could be reversed by destruction of superior 
    colliculus contralateral to the damaged cortex or section of the 
    intertectal commissure.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">Sprague&apos;s findings have been replicated both in cat 
    (Sherman, &apos;74, &apos;77) and rodents (Kirvel et al., &apos;74; 
    Schneider, &apos;751, and &quot;neural correlates&quot; of this 
    effect have also been reported in several mammals (Goodale, 
    &apos;73; Saraiva et al., &apos;76; Nagata et al., &apos;80).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">The intercollicular pathway, while thought to be 
    intimately involved in the Sprague effect (Sprague, &apos;66; 
    Sherman, &apos;74; Edwards, &apos;77; but see Nagata et al., 
    &apos;80 for an D.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    anatomical experiments.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s15">Only in cat (Edwards, &apos;77; Magalhses-Castro et al., 
    &apos;78; Maeda et al., &apos;791, and, to a lesser extent, rabbit 
    (Nagata et al., &apos;80), have intertectal connections been 
    studied with axoplasmic transport techniques.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s16">In these two species, both of which demonstrate phenomena 
    (see above cited references) suggestive of the intertectal 
    inhibition postulated by Sprague (&apos;661, the results have been 
    strikingly different.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s17">In cat (again, see the references cited above) the 
    rostra1 portions of the two colliculi are richly interconnected.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s18">In rabbit, on the other hand, horseradish peroxidase 
    (HRP) tracing experiments provided no evidence of intercollicular 
    connections.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s19">In view of these surprising species differences we have 
    investigated intercollicular connections in the hamster, another 
    mammal for which behavioral phenomena similar to those demonstrated 
    by Sprague have been reported (Schneider, &apos;75).</S>

    (&apos;50) referred to as the tectal semidecussation.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s178">Such fibers have been reported in cat (Edwards,

    &apos;70).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s179">Secondly, in several HRP experiments we found evidence 
    of intertectal terminations in the SGS, just below the collicular 
    surface.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s180">Such labeled fibers were not visible in our 
    autoradiographic material and the existence of terminal labeling in 
    the SGS was specifically denied by Edwards (&apos;77).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s181">Kawamura et al. (&apos;74: Fig. 3) did, however, 
    indicate some weak superficial layer degeneration following 
    contralateral collicular lesions in cat.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s182">It has been shown in cat (Powell, &apos;76; Berman and 
    Payne, &apos;80; Payne and Berman, &apos;81) that a crossed 
    corticotectal projection courses through the intercollicular 
    commissure and terminates in the superficial laminae.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s183">Such a projection has not, however, been observed in the 
    hamster (Rhoades and Chalupa, &apos;78).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s184">The only other source of crossed input to the 
    superficial laminae which has been well established is that from 
    the parabigeminal nucleus (Graybiel, &apos;78; Edwards et al., 
    &apos;79; Baleydier and Magnin, &apos;79; Watanabe and Kawana, 
    &apos;79; Sherk, &apos;791, and these fibers cross the midline in 
    the supraoptic, rather than the intertectal, commissure (Graybiel, 
    &apos;78; Watanabe and Kawana, &apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s185">It thus seems reasonable to suggest that the HRP-labeled 
    fibers in our material were of collicular origin, and that the 
    intertectal pathway may innervate, albeit quite weakly, the SGS.</S>

    of the neck.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s194">The portion of the visual field encompassed by 
    intertectal connections in cat and hamster is thus very different,

    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s195">That this difference and similarity exist at the same 
    time results from the fact that the portion of the colliculus 
    subtended by the representation of the head and neck is very 
    similar in cat (Stein et al., &apos;76) and hamster (Finlay et al. 
    &apos;78; Rhoades, &apos;go), while the magnification of the 
    central visual field is much greater in the former species (compare 
    the data of Feldon et al., &apos;70; and Lane et al., &apos;74; 
    with those of Finlay et al., &apos;78; and Rhoades, &apos;80).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s196">If the development of intertectal connections is 
    determined by one or more of the sensory representations in the 
    colliculus and this determination is similar for the hamster and 
    cat (the only species for which detailed information regarding both 
    collicular sensory topography, and intertectal connections are 
    available), then it seems likely that it is the somatosensory, 
    rather than the visual collicular representation, which is 
    important for the organization of intertectal pathway during 
    development.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s197">This argument is supported by the fact that most 
    intertectal neurons which possess sensory receptive fields are 
    somatosensory rather than visual (Rhoades et al., W), and the 
    additional finding that neonatal enucleation, a manipulation which 
    alters the topography of the visual, but not the somatosensory 
    representation in the colliculus ipsilateral to the remaining eye 
    (Rhoades, &apos;80), has no readily apparent effect on the 
    organization of intercollicular connections (Rhoades and Fish, 
    experiments in progress).</S>

    these connections may be involved primarily in the organization of 
    the motor output of the colliculus, both with respect to the 
    generation of small (e.g., tracking) eye movements and perhaps also 
    orientation to extravisual stimuli.</S>
    <BR />

     id="s204">That stimulation of the intercollicular pathway 
    monosynaptically inhibits contralateral, tectoreticular, and 
    tectospinal neurons in cat has now been established unequivocally 
    by the intracellular recordings of Maeda et al. (&apos;79).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s205">Our own extracellular recordings in hamster (Fish and 
    Rhoades, &apos;81b) have demonstrated that collicular stimulation

    contralateral tectum.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s206">While most of the cells influenced by contralateral 
    collicular shocks in our sample were located in the deep laminae 
    and were responsive to extravisual stimulation, the activity of a 
    number of exclusively visual, superficial layer neurons was 
    completely suppressed by such stimulation.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s207">Our methods were not sufficient to differentiate 
    monofrom polysynaptic connections, but the data do suggest that one 
    colliculus may influence not only the organization of motor output 
    in deep laminae, but also the processing of sensory input in the 
    superficial layers of its contralateral partner.</S>

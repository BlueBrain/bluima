     id="s1">Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been localized by 
    histochemistry in the superior colliculus and in the tegmentum of 
    the caudal midbrain and rostra1 pons of the rat.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s2">The pattern of AChE localization in the superior 
    colliculus was characterized by homogeneous staining in the 
    superficial layers and patchlike staining in the intermediate gray 
    layer.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s3">In the tegmentum, AChE was localized in the 
    pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), beginning rostrally at the caudal 
    pole of the substantia nigra and extending caudally to the level of 
    the parabrachial nuclei, and in the lateral dorsal tegmental 
    nucleus (LDTN) of the central gray.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s4">The localization of AChE in these nuclei overlapped the 
    distribution of neurons stained by immunohistochemistry using an 
    antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthesizing 
    enzyme of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">Other neighboring areas that were stained with AChE, but 
    that did not contain ChAT-immunoreactive neurons, included the 
    microcellular tegmental nucleus and the ventral tegmental 
    nucleus.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s6">Neurons in the PPN and LDTN were determined to be 
    potential sources of the cholinergic projection to the intermediate 
    gray layer of the rat superior colliculus by double labelling with 
    retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) combined with 
    the immunohistochemical localization of ChAT.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s7">Three populations of neurons were identified.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s8">A predominantly ipsilateral ChAT-immunoreactive population 
    was located in the pars compacta subdivision of PPN (PPNpc).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s9">Retrograde HRP-labelled neurons in the pars dissipata 
    subdivison of the PPN (PPNpd), located ventral to the superior 
    cerebellar peduncle (SCP) at the level of the inferior colliculus, 
    composed a second population that was predominantly contralateral 
    but was not ChAT immunoreactive.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s10">A third population of retrogradely labelled neurons was 
    predominantly ipsilateral and ChAT immunoreactive and was located 
    in the LDTN.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">These findings compared favorably with the full extent of 
    the projection from this tegmental region revealed by retrograde 
    transport of HRP from the superior colliculus when more compatible 
    fixation and chromogen procedures were used.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">The results suggest that the PPN and the LDTN are two 
    sources of the cholinergic input to the superior colliculus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">Since the PPN also has extensive efferent, and afferent, 
    connections with basal-ganglia-related structures, this cholinergic 
    excitatory input to the superior colliculus, like the GABAergic 
    inhibitory input from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, may 
    provide the basis for an additional influence of the basal ganglia 
    on visuomotor behavior.</S>

     id="s1">Lying just ventral to the medial geniculate nucleus and 
    dorsal to the cerebral peduncle, the peripeduncular area (PPA) 
    seems to be implicated in the expression of several sexual reflexes 
    in rodents.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s2">The aim of the present investigation was to establish the 
    organization of the afferent and efferent projections of the 
    rat&apos;s PPA in an attempt to provide a neural substrate 
    corresponding to the behavioral observations.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s3">Based on both retrograde and anterograde transport 
    methods, our results suggest that the PPA: 1) receives its main 
    afferent projections from the insulotemporal cortex, basal ganglia, 
    ventromedial and posterior hypothalamic nuclei, zona incerta, 
    inferior colliculus, intermediate and deep layers of the superior 
    colliculus, central gray, cuneiform nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental 
    nucleus, and dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and, 2) 
    projects essentially to the basal ganglia, ventromedial 
    hypothalamic nucleus, central gray, cuneiform and pedunculopontine 
    nuclei, deep layers of the superior collic-ulus, inferior 
    colliculus, and dorsal and ventral nuclei of the lateral 
    lemniscus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="abstract.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s4">These findings, indicating that the PPA is connected with 
    the auditory, motor, and limbic systems and with nonspecific 
    diencephalic and mesencephalic centers, are in agreement with the 
    notion that in rodents this area might play a role in the female 
    sexual receptivity (as expressed by lordosis display or ultrasound 
    production) or male mounting behavior.</S>

  <Introduction>

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s5">In rodents the sexually receptive female displays several 
    characteristic types of behavior such as lordosis and ultrasound 
    production (see review in Kirn and Floody, &apos;85; Yamanouchi et 
    al., &apos;85), which are under the control of both internal 
    (oestrogenic induction) and external (contacts by the male&apos;s 
    forearms on the female flanks) stimuli (Kow and Pfaff, 
    &apos;76).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s6">Investigations of the neural substrates of sexual 
    receptivity have focused on diencephalic, hormone-dependent centers 
    and on mesodiencephalic structures thought to be responsible for 
    the expression of these behavioral characteristics (Sakuma and 
    Pfaff, &apos;79a, b).</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s7">The peripeduncular nucleus is one of the mesodiencephalic 
    centers that seems to be implicated in the expression of the 
    lordosis reflex (Carrer, &apos;78; Edwards and Pfeifle, &apos;81; 
    Pfeifle and Edwards, &apos;83; L6pez and Carrer, &apos;85b).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s8">This nucleus belongs to the lateral tegmentum.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s9">Caudally, it is located beneath the medial geniculate 
    nucleus and 10strally, beneath the ventral lateral geniculate 
    nucleus.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s10">It is limited ventrally by the dorsal cap of the cerebral 
    peduncle.</S>
    <BR />

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s11">No systematic study of the overall pattern of connections 
    of the peripeduncular nucleus has yet been reported.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s12">On the one hand, however, this nucleus has been described 
    as projecting to the amygdaloid complex (see Ottersen, &apos;81) 
    and basal nucleus of Meynert (Jones et al., &apos;76) and as being 
    reciprocally connected with the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus 
    (see Krieger et al., &apos;79; Kita and Oomura, &apos;82b).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s13">On the other hand, the peripeduncular nucleus is 
    sometimes regarded in the cat and the monkey as being the analogue 
    of the interstitial nucleus of the brachium of the inferior 
    colliculus and, as such, is considered to belong to the auditory 
    system.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s14">This interpretation is supported by the fact that fibers 
    arising from the inferior colliculus (Moore and Goldberg, &apos;63, 
    &apos;66; Powell and Hatton, &apos;69) and from the Address reprint 
    requests to M.</S>

    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s18">Since the medial borders of this region are difficult to 
    establish with precision in this species, the expression 
    peripeduncular area (PPA) is preferred to peripeduncular nucleus in 
    the present study.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s19">Afferent connections were identified by using the 
    retrograde transport of either horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or 
    wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to HRP (WGA-HRP), whereas the 
    efferent system of connections was studied by using the anterograde 
    transport of WGA-HRP.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s20">This tracer is currently used as an anterograde label to 
    trace axonal pathways (Trojanowski et al., &apos;81; Mesulam, 
    &apos;82; Mantyh and Peschanski, &apos;83; Peschanski and Ralston, 
    &apos;85).</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"
     id="s21">This technique offers the advantage of being easy to use 
    and sensitive, especially when tetramethylbenzidine is employed as 
    the chromogen.</S>
    <S avgH="22" class="introduction.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    projections was further examined following tracer application into 
    some of the centers identified as being connected with the PPA.</S>

    &apos;81; Vomachka et al., &apos;82; King and Nance, &apos;85; Kirn

    and Gummesson, &apos;82; Pfeifle and Edwards, &apos;83) or 
    pentobarbital blockade (Lopez and Carrer, &apos;85b) of the 
    peripeduncular area induce a partial or total inhibition of the 
    lordosis reflex in the female and suppress the mounting behavior in 
    the male (Hansen and Gummesson, &apos;82).</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    ODonohue, &apos;80) and from electrical or chemical stimulation 
    experiments (Sakuma and Pfaff, &apos;79a; Sirinathsinghji,

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

     id="s173">In conclusion, our anatomical findings suggesting that 
    the PPA is connected with limbic, motor, auditory, and nonspecific 
    diencephalic and mesencephalic centers support the notion that this 
    area might play a role in the female sexual receptivity as well as 
    in the male mounting behavior.</S>
    <S avgH="21" class="discussion.body" format="TimesNewRomanPSMT"

A, IL-1beta was down-regulated (12 h - 24 h) following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1. Time course (48 h) of IL-1beta production (pg/ml) by human PBMC incubated with medium control, 100 mug GP, 250 ng TSST-1, GP + TSST-1, 250 ng LPS and GP + LPS. At 18 h and 24 h there was a marked reduction in IL-1beta production following GP + TSST-1 when compared to TSST-1 (* = p < 0.05). Graphs depicting the theoretical values for GP/LPS calc. and GP/TSST-1 calc. are also shown. IL-1beta levels in the supernatnant were obtained by Elisa and are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 3). B, IL-1RA was exaggerated following GP + TSST-1 (12 h - 48 h) when compared to TSST-1. Time course (48 h) of IL-1RA production (pg/ml) by human PBMC incubated with medium control, 100 mug GP, 250 ng TSST-1, GP + TSST-1, 250 ng LPS and GP + LPS. Between 18 h and 48 h a simultaneous treatment of PBMC with GP + TSST-1 led to a synergistic effect, i.e. a higher IL-1RA production when compared to an addition of the single values for TSST-1 and GP (* = p < 0.05). Graphs depicting the theoretical values for GP/LPS calc. and GP/TSST-1 calc. are included. IL-1RA levels in the supernatnant were obtained by Elisa and are shown as mean +/- SEM (n = 3).

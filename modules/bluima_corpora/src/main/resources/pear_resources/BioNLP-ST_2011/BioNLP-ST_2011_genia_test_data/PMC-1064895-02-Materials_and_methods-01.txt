Patients
Informed consent was obtained from 24 patients (5 men and 19 women) with RA who fulfilled the 1987 revised criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (formerly the American Rheumatism Association) [17]. The age of the patients with RA was 50 +/- 8 (mean +/- SEM) years (range 23-71 years). All medications were stopped 48 hours before entry to the study. Comparisons were made with 14 patients with OA (3 men and 11 women) and with 14 healthy controls (3 men and 11 women) who had no rheumatic diseases. The mean ages of the patients with OA and the healthy controls were 50 +/- 8 years (range 34-68 years) and 30 +/- 6 years (range 24-57 years). Informed consent was obtained, and the protocol was approved by the Catholic University of Korea Human Research Ethics Committee.

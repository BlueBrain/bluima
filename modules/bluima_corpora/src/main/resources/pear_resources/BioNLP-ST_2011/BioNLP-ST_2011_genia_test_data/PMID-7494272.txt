Oncogenicity of human papillomavirus- or adenovirus-transformed cells correlates with resistance to lysis by natural killer cells. 
The reasons for the dissimilar oncogenicities of human adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses (HPV) in humans are unknown but may relate to differences in the capacities of the E1A and E7 proteins to target cells for rejection by the host natural killer (NK) cell response. As one test of this hypothesis, we compared the abilities of E1A- and E7-expressing human fibroblastic or keratinocyte-derived human cells to be selectively killed by either unstimulated or interferon (IFN)-activated NK cells. Cells expressing the E1A oncoprotein were selectively killed by unstimulated NK cells, while the same parental cells but expressing the HPV type 16 (HPV-16) or HPV-18 E7 oncoprotein were resistant to NK cell lysis. The ability of IFN-activated NK cells to selectively kill virally transformed cells depends on IFN's ability to induce resistance to NK cell lysis in normal (i.e., non-viral oncogene-expressing) but not virally transformed cells. E1A blocked IFN's induction of cytolytic resistance, resulting in the selective lysis of adenovirus-transformed cells by IFN-activated NK cells. The extent of IFN-induced NK cell killing of E1A-expressing cells was proportional to the level of E1A expression and correlated with the ability of E1A to block IFN-stimulated gene expression in target cells. In contrast, E7 blocked neither IFN-stimulated gene expression nor IFN's induction of cytolytic resistance, thereby precluding the selective lysis of HPV-transformed cells by IFN-activated NK cells. In conclusion, E1A expression marks cells for destruction by the host NK cell response, whereas the E7 oncoprotein lacks this activity.

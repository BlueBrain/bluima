Histology.
18.5-dpc embryos were exsanguinated and peripheral blood smears were prepared from both mutant and WT mice. The slides were Wright-stained and read by DAF. For whole mount analysis, 14.5-dpc WT and mutant embryos, and postnatal day-10.5 mice were fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5 mum, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Liver samples (at 14.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc) were prepared in a similar manner. Images were obtained with Nikon Labophot-2 microscope. Objectives used were E Plan 40/0.65 160/0.17 Nikon (40x objective), E Plan 100/1.25 oil 160/0.17 Nikon (100x objective). The camera was a Nikon Coolpix 4300. Original images are available.

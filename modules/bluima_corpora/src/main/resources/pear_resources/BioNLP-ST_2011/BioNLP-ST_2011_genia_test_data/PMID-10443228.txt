[Hormonal metabolic status in breast cancer patients after conservative surgery: comparison with known prognostic criteria] 
Body weight, body mass index, body fat, lean body mass, blood-glucose, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, beta-lipoproteins, insulin, gonadotropin, estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, T3, T4 and TSH levels as well as estradiol and progesterone receptor levels in excised tumor were studied in 40 patients with breast cancer prior to conservative treatment. Said anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal parameters were compared with the index of lymphocytic infiltration of tumor selected as a prognostic factor. A significant correlation between high lymphocytic infiltration (2.5 points), low body mass and fat was identified. Also, smoking contributed to loss of body mass and fat; however, it caused lymphocytic infiltration to rise. Moderate body mass, relatively low fat level and positive receptor status are among factors of good prognosis in breast cancer of early stages.

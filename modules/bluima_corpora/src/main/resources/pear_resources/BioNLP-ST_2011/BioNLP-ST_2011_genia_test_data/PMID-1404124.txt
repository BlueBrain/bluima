Glucocorticoid receptor in patients with lupus nephritis: relationship between receptor levels in mononuclear leukocytes and effect of glucocorticoid therapy. 
We investigated the clinical significance of glucocorticoid receptor determination in 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who afterwards developed nephrotic syndrome. Glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) in these patients were comparable with those in both other patients with SLE and healthy persons. Improvement in urinary protein excretion and in disease activity, which was scored according to the SLE Disease Activity Index system of the University of Toronto, closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in MNL isolated from the corresponding patients. In summary, glucocorticoid receptor determination in patients with lupus nephritis may be a predictive clue for assessing responsiveness to glucocorticoid therapy.

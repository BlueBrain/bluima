Differential inhibition of Smad6 and Smad7 on bone morphogenetic protein- and activin-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis in B cells. 
Smad6 and Smad7 prevent ligand-induced activation of signal-transducing Smad proteins in the transforming growth factor-beta family. Here we demonstrate that both Smad6 and Smad7 are human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (hBMP-2)-inducible antagonists of hBMP-2-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in mouse B cell hybridoma HS-72 cells. Moreover, we confirmed that the ectopic expressions of Smad6 and Smad7 inhibited the hBMP-2-induced Smad1/Smad5 phosphorylation. We previously reported that Smad7 is an activin A-inducible antagonist of activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in HS-72 cells. Interestingly, although mRNA expression of Smad6 was induced by activin A in HS-72 cells, Smad6 showed no antagonistic effect on activin A-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, we found that the ectopic expression of Smad7, but not Smad6, inhibited the activin A-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in HS-72 cells. Thus, Smad6 and Smad7 exhibit differential inhibitory effects in bone morphogenetic protein-2- and activin A-mediated signaling in B lineage cells.

Mutations in the Pit-1 gene in children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency. 
Pit-1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor that binds to and transactivates promoters of growth hormone and prolactin genes. In three unrelated Japanese children with combined pituitary hormone deficiency, we identified three point mutations in the Pit-1 gene, Pro24Leu, Arg143Gln, and Arg271Trp, located on the major transactivation region, POU-specific domain, and POU-homeodomain, respectively.

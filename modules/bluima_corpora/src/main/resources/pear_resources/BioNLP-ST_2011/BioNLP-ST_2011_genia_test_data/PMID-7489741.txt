Interleukin-7 can induce the activation of Jak 1, Jak 3 and STAT 5 proteins in murine T cells. 
The activation of Janus protein tyrosine kinases (Jak) and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins has recently been linked to the signal transduction mechanism of several cytokines. IL-7 was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak 1 and Jak 3 and concomitantly, the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of multiple STAT proteins. The STAT proteins utilized by IL-7 were identical to those induced by IL-2 and could be identified as various STAT 5 isoforms. Moreover, the induction of both Jak 1 and 3, and STAT 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of IL-7, suggesting that this signal transduction mechanism may play a key role in IL-7-induced proliferation.

Quantification of IL-17 mRNA by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
PBMC were incubated with various concentrations of anti-CD3 in the presence or absence of inhibitors (LY294002, PDTC). After 16 hours of incubation, mRNA was extracted with RNAzol B (Biotex Laboratories, Houston, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription of 2 mug of total mRNA was performed at 42degreesC using the Superscripttrade reverse transcription system (Takara, Shiga, Japan). PCR amplification of cDNA aliquots was performed by adding 2.5 mM dNTPs, 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and 0.25 muM of sense and antisense primers. The reaction was performed in PCR buffer (1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) in a total volume of 25 mul. The following sense and antisense primers for each molecules were used: IL-17 sense, 5'-ATG ACT CCT GGG AAG ACC TCA TTG-3'; IL-17 antisense, 5'-TTA GGC CAC ATG GTG GAC AAT CGG-3'; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) sense, 5'-CGA TGC TGG GCG TGA GTA C-3'; GAPDH antisense, 5'-CGT TCA GCT CAG GGA TGA CC-3'. Reactions were processed in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT, USA) through cycles for 30 s of denaturation at 94degreesC, 1 min of annealing at 56degreesC for GAPDH and IL-17, followed by 1 min of elongation at 72degreesC. PCR rounds were repeated for 25 cycles each for both GAPDH and IL-17; this was determined as falling within the exponential phase of amplification for each molecule. The level of mRNA expression was presented as a ratio of IL-17 PCR product over GAPDH product.

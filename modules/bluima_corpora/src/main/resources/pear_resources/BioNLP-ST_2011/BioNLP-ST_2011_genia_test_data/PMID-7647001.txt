Expression of erythroid-specific genes in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down's syndrome. 
Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (M7) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down's syndrome (TMD) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers. To clarify properties of the blast cells in M7 and TMD cases, we examined erythroid markers expression in blasts from six cases with M7 and seven cases with TMD in this study. Erythroid-specific mRNAs encoding gamma-globin and erythroid delta-aminolevulinate synthase were found to be expressed in blasts from most of these cases, indicating that majorities of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes. We also found that mRNAs encoding GATA-1 and GATA-2 are expressed in all these cases. These results suggest that M7 blasts and TMD blasts correspond to the erythroid/megakaryocytic bipotential progenitor cells.

IL-17 mRNA expression in RA PBMC
To see whether enhanced IL-17 production could be regulated at a transcriptional level, semi-quantatitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed. We observed a dose-dependent increase in IL-17 mRNA transcripts after stimulation with anti-CD3; this was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and by the NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC (Fig. 5).

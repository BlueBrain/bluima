Activation of human CD4 T lymphocytes. Interaction of fibronectin with VLA-5 receptor on CD4 cells induces the AP-1 transcription factor. 
Fibronectin synergized with anti-CD3 antibody to promote CD4 cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when CD4 cells were cultured with anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone. In addition, anti-CD29 (integrin beta 1) as well as anti-VLA-5 (human fibronectin receptor) antibodies blocked this CD4 cell activation in this system. Although anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone cannot induce IL-2 message by CD4 cells, the combination of anti-CD3 plus fibronectin induced IL-2 message by CD4 cells. In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which IL-2 message was generated, we showed that a fibronectin-VLA-5 fibronectin receptor interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the CD3 pathway of activation by the induction of an AP-1 transcriptional factor. Thus the VLA-5 fibronectin receptor on CD4 cells can play a complementary role in CD3-TCR-mediated signal transduction through its interaction with fibronectin.

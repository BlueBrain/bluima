A, GP led to DNA binding of NFAT, NFkappaB and NFIL-6. Human PBMC were incubated with medium control or GP (1 and 100 mug) for 1 h at 37degreesC. Nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled NFAT, NFkappaB, NFIL-6 or NFkappaB-IL-8 oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-8 gene promoters (Table 1). Arrows with the black head indicate migrational location of the NFAT-DNA, NFkappaB-DNA, NFIL-6-DNA or NFkappaB-IL-8-DNA complex compared to free probe (no shift). Arrow with the open head indicates a supershift of NFkappaB-IL-8-DNA-anti-p65 and -p50, respectively. An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown (n = 7). B, Decreased DNA binding of NFkappaB following GP + TSST-1, compared to TSST-1, GP, or TSST-1/GP. Human PBMC were incubated with medium control, LPS, TSST-1, GP (100 mug), GP + TSST-1 and GP + LPS for 1 h at 37degreesC. An autoradiogram from a representative experiment is shown. Schematic representation of NFkappaB-DNA binding activity following GP (1 and 100 mug) or TSST-1 treatment (250 ng) as well as simultaneous administration of both compounds and the theoretical value (GP/TSST-1 calc.). Medium control levels were set equal to 1+/- SEM and significances (* = p < 0.05) are shown with respect to medium control (n = 4).

Lineage-specific activation of STAT3 by interferon-gamma in human neutrophils. 
Binding of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to its heterodimeric receptor induces activation of the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1alpha. Selective activation of STAT1alpha at the IFN-gamma receptor is achieved by specific interaction between a cytosolic tyrosine motif including Y440 in the IFN-gamma receptor alpha-chain and the SH2 domain of STAT1alpha. We demonstrate that, in addition to STAT1alpha, STAT3 is also activated by IFN-gamma in human neutrophils. The activation of STAT3 was not found in human eosinophils, monocytes, and HL-60 cells, although the STAT3 protein was expressed in these cells. The cell type-specific activation of STAT3 by IFN-gamma was also observed in neutrophils that are differentiated in vitro from human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. These results indicate that a single cytokine receptor can activate different STAT family members in a cell-specific manner, which might result in cell-specific gene transcription.

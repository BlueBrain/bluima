A novel B cell-derived coactivator potentiates the activation of immunoglobulin promoters by octamer-binding transcription factors. 
A novel B cell-restricted activity, required for high levels of octamer/Oct-dependent transcription from an immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) promoter, was detected in an in vitro system consisting of HeLa cell-derived extracts complemented with fractionated B cell nuclear proteins. The factor responsible for this activity was designated Oct coactivator from B cells (OCA-B). OCA-B stimulates the transcription from an IgH promoter in conjunction with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 but shows no significant effect on the octamer/Oct-dependent transcription of the ubiquitously expressed histone H2B promoter and the transcription of USF- and Sp1-regulated promoters. Taken together, our results suggest that OCA-B is a tissue-, promoter-, and factor-specific coactivator and that OCA-B may be a major determinant for B cell-specific activation of immunoglobulin promoters. In light of the evidence showing physical and functional interactions between Oct factors and OCA-B, we propose a mechanism of action for OCA-B and discuss the implications of OCA-B for the transcriptional regulation of other tissue-specific promoters.

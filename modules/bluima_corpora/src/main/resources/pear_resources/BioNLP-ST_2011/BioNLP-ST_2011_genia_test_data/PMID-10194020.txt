Evidence for a polyclonal etiology of palmar fibromatosis. 
X chromosome inactivation patterns at the androgen receptor locus were evaluated to determine clonality in microdissected lesional tissue and in leukocytes from 2 women with Dupuytren's disease. The tissue from both patients generated a polyclonal pattern of X chromosome inactivation of the human androgen receptor gene. This finding supports a polyclonal reactive process as the underlying etiology for palmar fibromatosis.

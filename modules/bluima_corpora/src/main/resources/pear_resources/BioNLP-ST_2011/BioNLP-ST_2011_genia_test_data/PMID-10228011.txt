HLA class I-mediated induction of cell proliferation involves cyclin E-mediated inactivation of Rb function and induction of E2F activity. 
Chronic rejection of transplanted organs is manifested as atherosclerosis of the blood vessels of the allograft. HLA class I Ags have been implicated to play a major role in this process, since signaling via HLA class I molecules can induce the proliferation of aortic endothelial as well as smooth muscle cells. In this study, we show that HLA class I-mediated induction of cell proliferation correlates with inactivation of the Rb protein in the T cell line Jurkat as well as human aortic endothelial cells. HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb can be inhibited specifically by neutralizing Abs to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), suggesting a role for FGF receptors in the signaling process. Signaling through HLA class I molecules induced cyclin E-associated kinase activity within 4 h in quiescent endothelial cells, and appeared to mediate the inactivation of Rb. A cdk2 inhibitor, Olomoucine, as well as a dominant-negative cdk2 construct prevented HLA class I-mediated inactivation of Rb; in contrast, dominant-negative cdk4 and cdk6 constructs had no effect. Furthermore, there was no increase in cyclin D-associated kinase activity upon HLA class I ligation, suggesting that cyclin E-dependent kinase activity mediates Rb inactivation, leading to E2F activation and cell proliferation.

GP modulated LPS- and TSST-1-induced binding to a new NFkappaB3 site in the IL-1RA promoter. Binding was enhanced for GP + LPS and GP + TSST-1, when compared to LPS, TSST-1, GP, GP/LPS calc. or GP/TSST-1 calc., respectively (* = p < 0.05; ** = p < 0.01). Medium control levels were set equal to 1 +/- SEM (n = 6). DNA binding was assessed by EMSA (see methods).

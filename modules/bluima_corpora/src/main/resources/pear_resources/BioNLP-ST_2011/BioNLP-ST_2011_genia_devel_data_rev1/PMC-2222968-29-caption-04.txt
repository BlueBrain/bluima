FOXP3 Induction During the Differentiation Process
(A) Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta (5 ng/ml) or IL-4 (25 ng/ml). The cells were harvested at different time points, and mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR for FOXP3 and GATA3 expression. Bars show the mean +/- SD of three independent experiments. 
(B) Intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown after exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to differentiating conditions as in part A of the figure. Data are representative of three independent experiments.

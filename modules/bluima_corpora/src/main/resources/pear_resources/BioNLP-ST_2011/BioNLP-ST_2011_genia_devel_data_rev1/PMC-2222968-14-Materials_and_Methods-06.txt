Cloning of the FOXP3 promoter and construction of mutant constructs.
The FOXP3 promoter was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega Biotech) to generate the pGL3 FOXP3 -511/+176 [24]. Site-directed mutagenesis in the FOXP3 promoter region were introduced using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primer and its complementary strand were used: GTT TCT CAT GAG CCC TAT TAA GTC ATT CTT ACC TCT CAC CTC TGT GGT GA.

GABP factors bind to a distal interleukin 2 (IL-2) enhancer and contribute to c-Raf-mediated increase in IL-2 induction. 
Triggering of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex activates two major signal cascades in T lymphocytes, (i) Ca2+-dependent signal cascades and (ii) protein kinase cascades. Both signal cascades contribute to the induction of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene during T-cell activation. Prominent protein kinase cascades are those that activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. We show here that c-Raf, which is at the helm of the classic MAP-Erk cascade, contributes to IL-2 induction through a distal enhancer element spanning the nucleotides from positions -502 to -413 in front of the transcriptional start site of the IL-2 gene. Induction of this distal IL-2 enhancer differs from induction of the proximal IL-2 promoter-enhancer, since it is induced by phorbol esters alone and independent from Ca2+ signals. In DNA-protein binding studies, we detected the binding of transcription factors GABP alpha and -beta to a dyad symmetry element (DSE) of the distal enhancer, which is formed by palindromic binding sites of Ets-like factors. Introduction of point mutations suppressing GABP binding to the DSE interfered with the induction of the distal enhancer and the entire IL-2 promoter-enhancer, while overexpression of both GABP factors enhanced the IL-2 promoter-enhancer induction. Overexpression of BXB, a constitutive active version of c-Raf, and of further members of the Ras-Raf-Erk signal cascade exerted an increase of GABP-mediated promoter-enhancer induction. In conjunction with previously published data on c-Raf-induced phosphorylation of GABP factors (E.Flory, A. Hoffmeyer, U.Smola, U.R.Rapp, and J.T.Bruder, J.Virol.70:2260- 2268, 1996), these results indicate a contribution of GABP factors to the Raf-mediated enhancement of IL-2 induction during T-cell activation.

TAT-GATA3 transduction.
CD4+CD45RA+ cells were cultured in AIMV medium and transduced with 20 nM, 10 nM, or 500 nM of full-length or truncated GATA3 over the course of 4 h. After 4 h, the cells were washed and activated with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and TGF-beta (10 ng/ml). Each day, the TAT proteins were freshly added to the medium. FOXP3 expression was measured after 5 d by intracellular staining.

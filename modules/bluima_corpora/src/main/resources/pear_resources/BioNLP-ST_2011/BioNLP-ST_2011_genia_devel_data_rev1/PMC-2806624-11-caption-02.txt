RUNX1 and RUNX3 expression in Foxp3+ T reg cells and in human CD4+, CD127-, CD25high cells. (A) Real-time PCR analysis of CD4+, CD127-, and CD25high T reg cells and CD4+, CD127+, and CD25neg T cells isolated from human peripheral blood showed an increased expression of IL-10, TGF-beta, FOXP3, and RUNX3 mRNA in CD25+ compared with CD25- cells. Bars show the mean +/- SE of three independent experiments. (B) Human tonsil sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Tissue sections were stained for FOXP3, RUNX1, RUNX3, and DAPI or isotype controls. HEK cells RUNX1-transfected or not transfected served as additional control for RUNX1 staining. Data shown are representative from one of the three tissue samples with similar results. Bars, 5 microm. Statistical differences were verified by the paired Student's t test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

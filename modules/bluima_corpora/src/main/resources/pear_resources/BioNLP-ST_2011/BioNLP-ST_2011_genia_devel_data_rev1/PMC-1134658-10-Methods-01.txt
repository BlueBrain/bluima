Cell culture
If not specified, all cells were cultured in X-VIVO 15trade (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) serum-free medium at 37degreesC and 5% CO2 in air. 
Peripheral blood was provided by the Blood Bank at Buskerud Regional Hospital with formal agreement by the patients, and approval by the regional ethics committee. Highly purified resting human B-lymphocytes (CD19+ cells) were isolated from the peripheral blood by rosetting with immunomagnetic beads (Dynabeads M450; Dynal, Oslo, Norway) as described [55]. This procedure yields less than 0.5% T cells, 0.1% NK cells, and 0.5% monocytes as judged by indirect immunofluorescence staining. 
The following cell lines from human lymphoid malignancies were maintained in RPMI 1640 (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units/ml of streptomycin sulphate, but serum-starved for at least four hours and cultured in X-VIVO 15trade when included in experiments: EBV-negative BL cell lines Ramos (ECACC 85030802), HL60 (JCRB0085).

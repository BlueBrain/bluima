Diminished capacity of Cbfb-deficient CD4-cre mice T cells in the generation of Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells. (A) FACS-purified naive CD4+ CD8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, +/- 10 nM retinoic acid (RA), and increasing concentrations of TGF-beta. After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA + ionomycin, and then analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-gamma expression. One of five experiments is shown. (B) Naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice (5 x 106 cells per transfer). 6 wk later, TCRbeta+CD4+ cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine (LP) were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. Results from one of four CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice with same findings are shown. The data from four sets of mice is shown in C. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test. *, P < 0.05 between groups.

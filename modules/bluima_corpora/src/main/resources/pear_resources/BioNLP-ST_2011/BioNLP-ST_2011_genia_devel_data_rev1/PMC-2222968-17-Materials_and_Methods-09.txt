Recombinant TAT proteins.
The cDNAs encoding GATA3 protein or the truncated GATA3 (lacking the two zinc fingers) were cloned in frame into an expression vector along with the TAT sequence as previously described [63]. Proteins were expressed in BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) and lysates were purified by Ni2+-chelate column chromatography. Both TAT-linked proteins were more than 95% pure, based on Coomassie blue staining of sodium disulfate acrylamide gels.

Transcriptional regulation of lysosomal acid lipase in differentiating monocytes is mediated by transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2. 
Human lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a hydrolase required for the cleavage of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides derived from plasma lipoproteins. It is shown here that during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, the expression of LAL-mRNA is induced. This induction is dependent on protein kinase C activity and protein synthesis. The cell type-specific increase in LAL expression is further investigated in the THP-1 cell line with respect to transcriptional regulation. The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 differentiates into macrophage-like cells when treated with phorbol esters. In order to determine the cis-acting elements necessary for both basal and phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA)-enhanced promoter activity, we performed deletion analysis and reporter gene assays. A PMA responsive element has been identified between -182 bp and -107 bp upstream of the major transcription start site. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that binding of Sp1 and AP-2 to the LAL promoter is increased by PMA in THP-1 cells. Co-transfections with expression plasmids for Sp1 and AP-2 further emphasized the important role of these transcription factors in both basal and PMA-enhanced LAL expression. Our data suggest that differentiation dependent increase of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) expression in THP-1 cells is mediated by a concerted action of Sp1 and AP-2.

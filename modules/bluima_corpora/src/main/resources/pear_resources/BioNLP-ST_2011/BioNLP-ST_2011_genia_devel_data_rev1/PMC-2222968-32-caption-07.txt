GATA3 Acts as a Negative Regulator of FOXP3 Expression
(A) Human naive CD4+CDRA+ T cells were transduced with 0, 20, 100, and 500 nM of TAT-GATA3 protein, and intracellular presence of GATA3 was analyzed using FACS following anti-CD3/CD28 activation of the cells. GFP-positive cells were gated and analyzed for intracellular FOXP3 expression following a 2-d incubation period (lower panel). Data are representative of four independent experiments. 
(B) CD4+CD25- T cells were isolated from D011.10 and D011.10xCD2-GATA3 mice and treated with OVA and TGF-beta for 96 h. Surface CD4 and intracellular FOXP3 were measured by FACS. These data are representative of three independent experiments. 
(C) The cells treated as in (B) were harvested and mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR for SMAD7 and TGF-beta expression. Bars show the mean +/- SD of three independent experiments.

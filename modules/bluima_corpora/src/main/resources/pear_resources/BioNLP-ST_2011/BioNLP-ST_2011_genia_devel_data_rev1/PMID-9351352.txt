Dysregulation of monocytic nuclear factor-kappa B by oxidized low-density lipoprotein. 
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)/Rel transcription factors may be involved in atherosclerosis, as is suggested by the presence of activated NF-kappa B in human atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) on the NF-kappa B system in human THP-1 monocytic cells as well as adherent monocytes. Our results demonstrate that short-term incubation of these cells with oxLDL activated p50/p65 containing NF-kappa B dimers and induced the expression of the target gene IL-8. This activation of NF-kappa B was inhibited by the antioxidant and H2O2 scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor PSI. The oxLDL-induced NF-kappa B activation was accompanied by an initial depletion of I kappa B-alpha followed by a slight transient increase in the level of this inhibitor protein. In contrast, long-term treatment with oxLDL prevented the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of I kappa B-alpha, accompanied by an inhibition of both NF-kappa B activation and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta genes. These observations provide additional evidence that oxLDL is a potent modulator of gene expression and suggest that (dys)regulation of NF-kappa B/Rel is likely to play an important role in atherogenesis.

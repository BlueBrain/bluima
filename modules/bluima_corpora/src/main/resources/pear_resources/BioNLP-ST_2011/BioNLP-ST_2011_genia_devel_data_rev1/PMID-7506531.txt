Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and T-cell activation by vanadate peroxide, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases. 
Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to T-lymphocytes. The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor, vanadate peroxide (pervanadate), on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T-cells. Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn (4- and 3-fold respectively) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, notably phospholipase C gamma 1. After this event, we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, corresponding to an influx. This effect required surface expression of the CD45 PTPase and was not observed in CD45-deficient variants of Jurkat cells. In the CD45-negative variant, the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing. Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T-lymphocyte activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25). Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T-cell antigen receptor engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production. Pervanadate activated NF-kappa B, as shown by an increase in DNA-binding activity of this transcription factor. We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T-lymphocyte activation. Moreover, induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation programme.

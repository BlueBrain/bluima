Cell proliferation
For estimation of DNA synthesis, CD19+ cells (7.5 x 104 cells/0.2 ml) or Ramos cells (1 x 104 cells/0.2 ml) were cultured in triplicate in microtiter wells. The cells were pulsed with 3.7 x 104Bq [3H]thymidine (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for the last 16 h of a 72-h incubation. The cells were harvested using an automated cell harvester (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT, USA) and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a scintillation counter (TopCount, Packard Instrument Company Inc., Meriden, CT).

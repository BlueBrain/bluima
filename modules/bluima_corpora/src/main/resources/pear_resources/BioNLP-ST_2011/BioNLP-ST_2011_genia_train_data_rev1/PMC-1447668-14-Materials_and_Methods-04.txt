Isolation of primary human CD4+ T cells.
CD4+ T cells were isolated from cryopreserved healthy donor PBMCs by negative selection with the CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to manufacturer's guidelines. Purity of negatively selected CD4+ T cells was consistently higher than 96% as determined by flow cytometry.

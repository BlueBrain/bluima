Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphoid cells. 
The induction of cell death in lymphoid cells by glucocorticoids is one of the earliest and most thoroughly studied models of apoptosis. Although the exact mechanism by which apoptosis occurs in lymphocytes is unknown many biochemical and molecular changes have been shown to occur in these cells in response to glucocorticoids. The role of chromatin degradation and endonucleases in the apoptotic process has been closely studied, as well as the involvement of several oncogenes in glucocorticoid-induced cell lysis. In addition, the clinical importance of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms has recently received increased attention.

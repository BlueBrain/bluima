Suppression of TNFalpha-mediated NFkappaB activity by myricetin and other flavonoids through downregulating the activity of IKK in ECV304 cells. 
Flavonoids are a group of naturally-occurring phenolic compounds in the plant kingdom, and many flavonoids are found with vascular protective properties. Nevertheless how the protective response is exerted by flavonoids is not well characterized. In view of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) may play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis, prevention of the activation of NFkappaB represents an important role in protecting vascular injury. In this study, the effects of flavonoids on NFkappaB/inhibitor-kappaB (IkappaB) system in ECV304 cells activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) were examined. We investigated the inhibitory action of six flavonoids on IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity, an enzyme recently found to phosphorylate critical serine residues of IkappaB for degradation. Of six flavonoids tested, myricetin was found to strongly inhibit IKK kinase activity, and prevent the degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in activated endothelial cells. Furthermore, myricetin was also found to inhibit NFkappaB activity correlated with suppression of monocyte adhesion to ECV304 cells. Therefore we conclude that flavonoids may be of therapeutic value for vascular disease through down regulation of NFkappaB/IkappaB system. Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Expression and genomic configuration of GM-CSF, IL-3, M-CSF receptor (C-FMS), early growth response gene-1 (EGR-1) and M-CSF genes in primary myelodysplastic syndromes. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seventeen patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in advanced stage were enriched for blasts and tested for (1) karyotype, (2) genomic configuration and (3) expression of IL-3, GM-CSF, FMS and EGR-1 genes which are all located on the long arm of chromosome 5. The expression of the M-CSF gene, that has been recently reassigned to the short arm of chromosome 1 (lp), was also investigated. Aims of the study were to (1) assess the potential role of the expression of these genes in the maintenance and expansion of the neoplastic clones and (2) search for constitutional losses or rearrangements of one allele followed by a deletion of the second allele of the same genes in the leukemic cells. The latter issue was investigated by comparing, in 8 cases, constitutive DNA from skin fibroblasts with leukemic DNA. Eleven of the 17 patients had abnormal karyotypes. The M-CSF gene was expressed in 6 cases and the FMS and the EGR-1 genes were expressed in 2 of the latter cases. An autocrine mechanism of growth could be hypothesized only for the 2 patients whose cells expressed both the M-CSF and FMS genes. No germline changes or rearrangements were observed in any of the genes studied. Thus, deregulation of genes encoding for certain hemopoietic growth factors or receptors does not seem to represent a major mechanism of MDS progression.

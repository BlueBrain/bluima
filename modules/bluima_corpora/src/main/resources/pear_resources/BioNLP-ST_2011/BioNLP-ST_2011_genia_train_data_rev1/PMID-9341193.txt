The tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 mediates the transactivation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B promoter through interactions with the zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1. 
Transcriptional up-regulation of the c-sis/platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) proto-oncogene by the Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 has been implicated as one possible mechanism of cellular transformation by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. In previous work, we identified an essential site in the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter, Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE1), necessary for transactivation by Tax. We also identified Sp1, Sp3, and NGFI-A/Egr-1 as the primary nuclear transcription factors binding to TRE1 which mediate Tax responsiveness. In the present work, we have investigated the mechanism(s) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene. In vitro transcription assays showed that Tax was able to significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a template containing the -257 to +74 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis showed that Tax increased the DNA binding activity of both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1 using a TRE1 probe. Analysis of Tax mutants showed that two mutants, IEXC29S and IEXL320G, were unable to significantly transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Tax is able to stably bind to both Sp1 and NGFI-A/Egr-1. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant IEXC29S is unable to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1, whereas Tax mutant IEXL320G is able to interact with NGFI-A/Egr-1.

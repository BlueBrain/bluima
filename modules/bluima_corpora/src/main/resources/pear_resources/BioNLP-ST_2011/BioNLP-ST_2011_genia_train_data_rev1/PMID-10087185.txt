Decreased proteasome-mediated degradation in T cells from the elderly: A role in immune senescence. 
Induction of NFkappaB is a highly regulated process requiring phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor IkappaBalpha. Analyses of the regulation of IkappaBalpha in TNF-alpha-treated T lymphocytes from young and elderly donors revealed severely compromised degradation of IkappaBalpha in T cells from the elderly. Examination of activation-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha did not demonstrate any significant age-related alterations. However, examination of proteasome activity in these T cells using fluorogenic peptide assays revealed a significant age-related decline in chymotryptic activity. These results suggest that a decline in proteasome activity results in a failure to fully degrade IkappaBalpha in the elderly. This failure to degrade IkappaBalpha may underlie both the observed decrease in NFkappaB induction and the IL-2 receptor expression in TNF-treated T cells during aging. Thus, decreased proteasome-mediated degradation may be central to immune dysfunction that accompanies aging. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

Polymorphic nucleotides within the human IL-4 promoter that mediate overexpression of the gene. 
Atopy, which predisposes individuals to develop asthma, severe systemic anaphylaxis, and atopic dermatitis, is usually associated with dramatically elevated total serum IgE levels and is thought to be controlled by a major susceptibility gene and multiple minor susceptibility genes. A recent sib-pair analysis revealed a tight linkage between markers on 5q31.1 and a major susceptibility gene controlling total serum IgE levels. Due to its location within this cluster and its biologic role in Ig class switching and Th2 cell differentiation, the IL-4 gene has emerged as one major candidate for the atopy gene. In one model, polymorphisms within IL-4 regulatory elements might result in overexpression of the gene, amplifying Th2 cell differentiation and class switching to IgE. In support of this model, we report that the human IL-4 promoter exists in multiple allelic forms that exhibit distinct transcriptional activities in IL-4-positive T cells. A particular allele has an unusually high transcriptional activity. A nucleotide substitution within a recently described OAP40 element located just upstream of an NF-AT site (P sequence) appears to be largely responsible for the increased promotor strength of this particular allelic form of the IL-4 promoter. In EMSAs, this substitution results in a markedly enhanced affinity for sequence-specific complexes exhibiting an AP-1 specificity. The identification of allelic nucleotides, which results in overexpression of the IL-4 gene, provides specific targets for a comprehensive screening of atopic and nonatopic individuals and may provide a clue for genetic predisposition for atopy.

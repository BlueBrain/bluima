Identification of a human LIM-Hox gene, hLH-2, aberrantly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and located on 9q33-34.1. 
We describe the isolation of human LH-2, a putative transcription factor containing two cysteine-rich regions (LIM domains) and a homeobox (Hox) DNA-binding domain. High levels of hLH-2 expression were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) tested, regardless of disease status. hLH-2 was mapped to chromosome 9Q33-34.1, in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the BCR-ABL chimera of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph'), the hallmark of CML; hLH-2 was retained on the derivative 9 chromosome and is therefore centromeric of c-ABL. The proximity of hLH-2 to the breakpoint on chromosome 9 raises the possibility of cis-activation by the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. In addition to finding hLH-2 expression in all cases of CML, expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines, but not in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The role of hLH-2 in the development or progression of leukaemia is not known. However, hLH-2 may prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual disease.

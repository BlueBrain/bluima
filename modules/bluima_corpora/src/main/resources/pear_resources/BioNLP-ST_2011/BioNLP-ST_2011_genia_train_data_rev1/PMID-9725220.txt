Transcription of a minimal promoter from the NF-IL6 gene is regulated by CREB/ATF and SP1 proteins in U937 promonocytic cells. 
NF-IL6 is an important transcriptional regulator of genes induced in activated monocytes/macrophages, and NF-IL6 is the only CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family member whose steady-state mRNA levels increase upon activation of monocytes (1). We show that increased transcription of the NF-IL6 gene is responsible, at least in part, for induction of NF-IL6 mRNA following activation of U937 promonocytic cells. We have identified a 104-bp minimal promoter region of the NF-IL6 gene that is sufficient for basal and activation-dependent induction of transcription in U937 cells. This region contains binding sites for the cAMP response element-binding protein/activation transcription factor (CREB/ATF) and Sp1 families of transcription factors. Each site is functionally important and contributes independently to transcription of the NF-IL6 gene in U937 cells.

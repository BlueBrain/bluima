Peripheral T lymphocytes from women with breast cancer exhibit abnormal protein expression of several signaling molecules. 
We examined signaling molecules of peripheral blood T lymphocytes obtained from women with breast cancer. In 6 of 14 patients, T lymphocytes displayed an impaired ability to translocate NFeB p65 (Rel-A) following activation by anti-CD3 and IL-2. This observation was made despite normal cytoplasmic levels of the Rel-A protein. We also detected abnormally low levels of the signaling molecules T-cell receptor (TCR)-zeta, ZAP-70 and p56lck in 4 of 14 breast cancer patients, i.e., defects in T-cell signaling molecules. T lymphocytes from 6 of the 14 patients also exhibited an increased expression of the dual specificity phosphatase, map kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). MKP-1 inactivates MAP kinase and therefore may interfere with the activation of c-jun and c-fos. Abnormalities of I or more signaling molecules were found in 9 of 14 patients; however, only 3 patients had T cells that exhibited all 5 defects. Our data have implications for the detection of potentially dysfunctional T cells in patients with cancer. For example, the analysis of only 1 signaling molecule may allow patients with significant defects in T-cell signaling to go unnoticed. Finally, despite impaired Rel-A translocation, T cells were capable of transcribing IL-2. Impairments in the translocation of Rel-B and c-Rel further suggest that the NFKB family members Rel-A, Rel-B and c-Rel are not required for the transcription of IL-2 in the peripheral T lymphocytes of patients with breast cancer.

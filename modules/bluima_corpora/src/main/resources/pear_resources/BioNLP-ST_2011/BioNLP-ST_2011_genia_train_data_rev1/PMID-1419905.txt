Activation of NF-kappa B by interleukin 2 in human blood monocytes. 
We report here that interleukin 2 (IL-2) acts on human blood monocytes by enhancing binding activity of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to its consensus sequence in the 5' regulatory enhancer region of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (p55). Similarly, IL-2 activates NF-kappa B in the human monocytic cell line U 937, but not in resting human T-cells. This effect is detectable within 15 min and peaks 1 h after exposure to IL-2. Enhanced NF-kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF-kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF-kappa B consensus sequence (-291 to -245) of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated. In addition, IL-2 is capable of increasing transcript levels of the p50 gene coding for the p50 subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor, whereas mRNA levels of the p65 NF-kappa B gene remained unchanged.

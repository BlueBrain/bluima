Association between expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 in adult T-cell leukemia cells. 
It is known that the expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in adult T cell leukemia(ATL) cells are high, whereas those in T-lymphoid cells are not. In order to investigate the factors that influence the induction of ICAM-1 molecules, Northern blot analysis to measure the expression level of ICAM-1 mRNAs and Southern blot hybridization to analyze the integration of human T-cell-leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus were done. The levels of ICAM-1 mRNA expression of ATL cells were generally higher than those of T-lymphoid cells. However, ILT-mat cells and ATL16T(-) cells, although they were ATL cells, showed rather low surface ICAM-1 expression and ICAM-1 mRNA expression. Southern blot hybridization showed that only two and four bands were found in ILT-mat and ATL16T(-) cells, respectively, whereas > 10 bands were detected in other ATL cells. These results suggest that monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus to the genome of T cell, especially the number of integration sites, is one of the factors for induction of ICAM-1 molecules.

The Carboxyl-Terminal FKH Domain Is Not Required for Suppression of NF-kappaB Activation in T Cells
To define the requirements of Foxp3 with respect to inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent transcription, we utilized a mutant of Foxp3 lacking the FKH domain (Figure 2A) [16], similar to the scurfy mutant Foxp3 of mice, and a mutant Foxp3 protein from a patient with IPEX [4,11,14,17]. Unlike full-length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence-specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the DeltaFKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [16]. Therefore, we utilized the DeltaFKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization (or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus. Overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not of DeltaFKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF-kappaB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells (Figure 2B). Both Foxp3 and DeltaFKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real-time RT-PCR (unpublished data). These data appear to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is critically important for Foxp3 to down-regulate NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. However, NF-kappaB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full-length Foxp3 and DeltaFKH in Jurkat T cells (Figure 2C) and primary human CD4+ T cells (Figure 2D). Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and DeltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E). These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations. Alternative interpretations may include the possibility that the localization of DeltaFKH differ between epithelial cells and T cells. In either case, these results suggest a cell type-specific mechanism of action for this Foxp3 mutant.

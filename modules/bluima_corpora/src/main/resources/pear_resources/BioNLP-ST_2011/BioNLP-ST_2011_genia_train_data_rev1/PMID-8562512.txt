Cross-linking of Fc gamma receptors activates HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven transcription in human monocytes. 
Elevation of the levels of circulating immune complexes frequently accompanies HIV-1 infection and is a prognostic indicator of clinical progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS. Here we report that cross-linking of Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII by adherent human IgG or by specific anti-Fc gamma R mAb activates HIV-1 gene expression in the human monocytic cell line BF24 and increased HIV RNA expression in monocytes from HIV infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription-PCR. In THP-1 cells, Fc gamma R cross-linking induced NF-kappa B, which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1 and to activate HIV-1 transcription. Anti-TNF-alpha antibody but not anti-IL-1 beta antibody strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription and the induction of NF-kappa B by Fc gamma R cross-linking. These results indicate that Fc gamma R can mediate a TNF-alpha-dependent induction of HIV-1 gene transcription and suggest that immune complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes.

Increased interleukin 2 transcription in murine lymphocytes by ciprofloxacin. 
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ciprofloxacin (cipro), induces hyperproduction of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In this investigation an enhanced and prolonged IL-2 and IL-2 mRNA response was also detected in both stimulated (T cell mitogens or alloantigens) murine splenocytes and in the stimulated murine T cell line EL-4 in the presence of ciprofloxacin (5-80 micrograms/ml) as compared to control cells without antibiotics. However, in contrast to human lymphocytes, IFN-gamma production was inhibited and IFN-gamma mRNA levels were unaffected at 24 h and only slightly upregulated at 48 and 72 h of culture in murine splenocytes incubated with cipro (20 micrograms/ml). EL-4 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the IL-2 promoter and enhancer region linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Analysis of CAT activity revealed that cipro enhanced IL-2 gene induction. In addition, EL-4 cells incubated with ciprofloxacin showed an early peak and more activated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1) as compared to control cells without antibiotics. Cipro did not affect the nuclear transcription factors AP-1 or NFIL-2A. Taken together, cipro inhibited IFN-gamma synthesis, but enhanced IL-2 production in murine lymphocytes by means of influencing NFAT-1 and causing an increased IL-2 transcription.

Mitogen stimulation of T-cells increases c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels, AP-1 binding and AP-1 transcriptional activity. 
We have analysed the effect of mitogenic lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels as well as on activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding and enhancer activity in Jurkat T-cells. Both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were increased after Con A and PHA stimulation. Since T-cell stimulation increases both intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels and activates protein kinase C (PKC), the possible involvement of these intracellular messengers in c-Fos and c-Jun induction was tested. PMA, which directly activates PKC, mimicked the effect of the lectins on c-Fos and c-Jun, but elevation of either intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP levels had little or no effect. The mitogen-induced increase of c-Fos and c-Jun immunoreactivity was inhibited by H-7, a kinase inhibitor with relatively high specificity for PKC, and less efficiently by H-8, a structurally related kinase inhibitor less active on PKC, but more active on cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases. Con A stimulation was found to increase both binding of AP-1 to the AP-1 consensus sequence, TRE, and AP-1 enhancer activity, in Jurkat cells. PMA was also found to increase the AP-1 enhancer activity, whereas elevation of Ca2+ or cAMP had only minor effects. We conclude that stimulation with mitogenic lectins is sufficient to increase both c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels, AP-1 binding and AP-1 enhancer activity in Jurkat cells and that they act via mechanisms that could involve the activation of PKC.

A CD28-associated signaling pathway leading to cytokine gene transcription and T cell proliferation without TCR engagement. 
Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28-specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis without further requirement for TCR coengagement. This observation prompted us to postulate that signal 2 (costimulatory signal) alone without signal 1 (TCR signal) can activate T cells. To test whether this putative function of CD28 is mediated via a particular signaling pathway, we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9.3. Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+, but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56(lck) and c-Raf-1. This pathway resulted in the induction of the transcription factors NF-kappa B, NF-AT, and proteins binding to the CD28 response element of the IL-2 promoter. On the other hand, stimulation of T cells with mAb 9.3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ and triggered the activation of p56(lck) and c-Raf-1, but was unable to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL-2 promoter. In contrast to the differential signaling of BW 828 and 9.3 in resting T cells, the two mAbs exhibited a similar pattern of early signaling events in activated T cells and Jurkat cells (p56(lck) activation, association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with CD28), indicating that the signaling capacity of CD28 changes with activation. These data support the view that stimulation through CD28 can induce some effector functions in T cells and suggest that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events.

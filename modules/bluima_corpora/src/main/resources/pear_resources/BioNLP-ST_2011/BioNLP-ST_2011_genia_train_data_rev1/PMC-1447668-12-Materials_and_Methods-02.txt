Patients and cell preparation.
PBMCs were prepared by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque gradients (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Maryland, United States) from eight HAM/TSP patients and eight ACs, and the cells were viably cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until tested. HAM/TSP was diagnosed according to WHO guidelines [49]. HTLV-I seropositivity was determined by ELISA (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, United States), with confirmation by Western blot analysis (Genelabs Technologies, Redwood City, California, United States). Blood samples were obtained after informed consent as part of a clinical protocol reviewed and approved by the NIH institutional review panel.

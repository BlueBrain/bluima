Transcriptional regulation of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase B2 subunit gene in differentiating THP-1 cells. 
Monocyte-macrophage differentiation was used as a model system for studying gene regulation of the human vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). We examined mRNA levels of various V-ATPase subunits during differentiation of both native monocytes and the cell line THP-1, and found that transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms could account for increases in cell V-ATPase content. From nuclear runoff experiments, we found that one subunit in particular, the B2 isoform (Mr = 56,000), was amplified primarily by transcriptional means. We have begun to examine the structure of the B2 subunit promoter region. Isolation and sequencing of the first exon and 5'-flanking region of this gene reveal a TATA-less promoter with a high G + C content. Primer extension and ribonuclease protection analyses indicate a single major transcriptional start site. We transfected promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids into THP-1 cells to define sequences that mediate transcriptional control during monocyte differentiation. We found that sequences downstream from the transcriptional start site were sufficient to confer increased expression during THP-1 differentiation. DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis revealed the existence of multiple AP2 and Sp1 binding sites in the 5'-untranslated and proximal coding regions.

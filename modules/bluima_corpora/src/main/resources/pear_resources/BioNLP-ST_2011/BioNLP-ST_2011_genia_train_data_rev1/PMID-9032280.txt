Transcription mediated by NFAT is highly inducible in effector CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells but not in Th1 cells. 
Transcriptional factors of the NFAT family play an important role in regulating the expression of several cytokine genes during the immune response, such as the genes for interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-4, among others. Upon antigen stimulation, precursor CD4+ T helper (pTh) cells proliferate and differentiate into two populations of effector cells (eTh1 and eTh2), each one expressing a specific pattern of cytokines that distinguishes them from their precursors. eTh2 cells are the major source of IL-4, while gamma interferon is produced by eTh1 cells. Here we have used reporter transgenic mice to show that DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFAT are transiently induced during the differentiation of pTh cells into either eTh1 or eTh2 cells to mediate the expression of IL-2 as a common growth factor in both pathways. However, although NFAT DNA binding is similarly induced in both eTh1 and eTh2 cells upon antigen stimulation, only the NFAT complexes present in eTh2 cells are able to mediate high-level transcription, and relatively little NFAT transcriptional activity was induced in eTh1 cells. In contrast to activated pTh cells, neither eTh1 nor eTh2 cells produced significant IL-2 upon stimulation, but the high levels of NFAT transcriptional activities directly correlate with the IL-4 production induced in response to antigen stimulation in eTh2 cells. These data suggest that activated NFAT is involved in the effector function of eTh2 cells and that the failure of eTh1 cells to produce IL-4 in response to an antigen is due, at least partially, to a failure to induce high-level transcription of the IL-4 gene by NFAT. Regulation of NFAT could be therefore a critical element in the polarization to eTh1 or eTh2.

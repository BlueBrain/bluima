A novel SP-1 site in the human interleukin-1 beta promoter confers preferential transcriptional activity in keratinocytes. 
To investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional activation of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in non-monocytic cells, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to various parts of the human IL-1beta promoter and performed transient transfection experiments. We identified a promoter segment that activates transcription most efficiently in keratinocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with a 43-mer oligonucleotide derived from the functionally identified cis-acting element revealed specific complexes. By competition analysis with transcription factor consensus sequence oligonucleotides and by immunosupershift, transcription factor SP-1 or a closely related protein was shown to bind to this regulatory element. The closest match to the known SP-1 consensus sequence within the respective region is a TCCCCTCCCCT motif. Mutation of this motif almost completely, and specifically, abolished the binding of two low-mobility complexes and led to a 95% decrease of constitutive transcriptional activation of a reporter construct IL-1beta (-170/+108). Likewise, activation of this reporter construct by tumor necrosis factor-alpha depended on the SP-1 site. These observations suggest that a so-far-unrecognized SP-1 site in the human IL-1beta promoter may participate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene in keratinocytes.

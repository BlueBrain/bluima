An interferon-gamma activation sequence mediates the transcriptional regulation of the IgG Fc receptor type IC gene by interferon-gamma. 
Expression of the IgG Fc receptor type I (Fc gamma RI) on myeloid cells is dramatically increased by treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We observed that Fc gamma RI transcript levels in monoblast-like U937 cells were elevated within 3 hr and peaked 12 hr after exposure to IFN-gamma. Treatment of U937 with IFN-gamma for 9 hr in the presence of cycloheximide led to super-induction of Fc gamma RI expression. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that the rate of Fc gamma RI transcription was increased by IFN-gamma. Genomic sequence upstream of the Fc gamma RIC gene was cloned and subjected to primer extension analysis, which demonstrated a single transcription initiation site without a TATA box. Transient transfections of CAT reporter gene constructs containing various Fc gamma RIC promoter sequences into U937 cells revealed that a 20-bp region surrounding the transcription start site (-7 to +13) was capable of mediating transcription initiation and that an IFN-gamma responsive element (GIRE) was present within 74 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. A 17-bp sequence between positions -51 and -35 conferred IFN-gamma responsiveness on a heterologous promoter. Double-stranded GIRE sequence, but not a scrambled sequence, was specifically bound by nuclear proteins from IFN-gamma treated U937 cells. Gel shift experiments further showed that the STAT1 alpha protein bound to the Fc gamma RIC GIRE in response to IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells. The Fc gamma RIC GIRE is homologous to the IFN-gamma activation sequence (GAS) of the guanylate binding protein and to X box elements of class II MHC genes. Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the Fc gamma RIC gene by IFN-gamma involves the binding of STAT1 alpha to a 17-bp GAS homology in the proximal promoter.

Stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta production in human monocytes by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors. 
Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates. In human monocytes, the inhibitors of these phosphatases, okadaic acid and calyculin A, were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-1 alpha. The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin-1 genes. Stimulation of interleukin-1 gene transcription may be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities, including those of AP-1, by these protein phosphatase inhibitors. Okadaic acid increased the synthesis of the interleukin-1 beta precursor and mature forms and their secretion. This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL-1 beta convertase mRNA accumulation. The stimulation of interleukin-1 alpha production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin-1 beta. However, the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin-1 alpha cytokine was increased. These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and suggest that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin-1 production.

Analysis of Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 Pathways in Contribution to the Growth and Survival of Lymphoma Cells
(A-D) Immunoblot analysis of wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas for Akt, NFkappaB, and Stat3 signaling after treatment with (A) an Akt inhibitor, triciribine, (B) an NFkappaB inhibitor, BAY11-7085, and the Stat3 inhibitors (C) cucurbitacin I and (D) AG490, at the indicated concentrations. Arrows indicate the positions of alpha and beta isoforms of Stat3. Actin was used as a loading control.

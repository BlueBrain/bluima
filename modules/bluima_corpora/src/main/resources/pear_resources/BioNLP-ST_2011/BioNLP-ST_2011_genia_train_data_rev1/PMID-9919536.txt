Inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in vitro and in vivo: role of 26S proteasome. 
It is becoming increasingly apparent that NF-kappa B plays a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response. Data obtained from studies in our laboratories demonstrate that the proteasome plays an important role in the inflammatory cascade by regulating the activation of NF-kappa B. Indeed, the availability of selective and orally active proteasome inhibitors should prove useful in delineating the roles of the proteasome and NF-kappa B in other pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and heart disease.

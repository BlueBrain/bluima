An allosteric drug, o,o'-bismyristoyl thiamine disulfide, suppresses HIV-1 replication through prevention of nuclear translocation of both HIV-1 Tat and NF-kappa B. 
The efficacy of o,o'-bismyristoyl thiamine disulfide (BMT) was examined in detail against HIV-1 laboratory isolates (HTLV-IIIB, JRFL, and MN), primary isolates (KMT and KMO), and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251) in vitro. BMT inhibited the replication of HIV-1 in both laboratory and primary isolates in vitro. In addition, BMT exhibited antiviral activity against SIVmac251. Minimizing energy studies of BMT structure reveal that a trans-disulfide of thiamine (holo drug) disulfide (TDS, protodrug) is allosterically transited to the reactive twisted disulfide of BMT (allo drug) by o,o'-bismyristoyl esterification of TDS. BMT inhibits nuclear translocation of both HIV-1 transactivator (TAT) and the cellular transcriptional nuclear factor-KB (NF-kappa B), resulting in the suppression of HIV-1 replication.

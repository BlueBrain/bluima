Molecular regulation of cytokine gene expression during the immune response. 
Cytokine expression by immune system cells plays an important role in the regulation of the immune response. On first encounter with antigen, naive CD4+ T helper (Th) cells differentiate into cytokine-producing effector cells. Two types of effector cells characterized by their distinct expression of cytokine profiles have been described. Th1 cells produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13. In many pathological situations, the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses determines the outcome of diverse immunologically mediated clinical syndromes including infectious, autoimmune, and allergic diseases. However, the molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression of Th1/Th2-like cytokines has remained elusive. In this review we evaluate the possible in vivo role of different transcription factors and transcriptional mechanisms in T cell differentiation and the immune response.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat upregulates interleukin-2 secretion in activated T cells. 
Dysregulation of cytokines secreted by T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS. To investigate the effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat on interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression, we used IL-2 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs and IL-2-secreting Jurkat T cells as a model system. Transient expression of HIV-1 Tat induced a five- to eightfold increase in IL-2 promoter activity in Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol myristate acetate. IL-2 secretion was increased more than twofold in both Jurkat T cells and primary T cells stimulated by extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein. Analysis of mRNA suggested that Tat exerts its effect on IL-2 primarily at the transcriptional level. The NF-kappa B site at positions -206 to -195 of the IL-2 promoter was required but not sufficient for the Tat effect. The Tat-mediated increase in IL-2 promoter activity could selectively be blocked by antisense tat or-unlike the analogous effect of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax-by cyclosporin A. The observed increase in IL-2 levels might facilitate virus spread from or to T cells. Furthermore, it might contribute to the hypergammaglobulinemia or, together with other cytokines found to be dysregulated, the T-helper cell dysfunctions observed in AIDS patients.

LMP-1 activates NF-kappa B by targeting the inhibitory molecule I kappa B alpha. 
LMP-1, an Epstein-Barr virus membrane protein expressed during latent infection, has oncogenic properties, as judged from its ability to transform B lymphocytes and rodent fibroblasts. LMP-1 induces the expression of bcl2, an oncogene which protects cells from apoptosis, as well as of genes encoding other proteins involved in cell regulation and growth control. The mechanisms by which LMP-1 upregulates these proteins is unknown, but it is plausible that LMP-1 modifies signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of one or more transcription factors that ultimately regulate transcription of oncogenic genes. NF-kappa B, a transcription factor controlling the expression of genes involved in cell activation and growth control, has been shown to be activated by LMP-1. The mechanism(s) regulating this activation remains unknown. Our data indicate that increased NF-kappa B DNA binding and functional activity are present in B-lymphoid cells stably or transiently expressing LMP-1. I kappa B alpha is selectively modified in LMP-1-expressing B cells. A phosphorylated form of I kappa B alpha and increased protein turnover-degradation correlate with increased NF-kappa B nuclear translocation. This results in increased transcription of NF-kappa B-dependent-genes, including those encoding p105 and I kappa B alpha (MAD3). These results indicate that LMP-1 activates NF-kappa B in B-cell lines by targeting I kappa B alpha. Identification of the pathways activated by LMP-1 to result in posttranslational modifications of I kappa B alpha will aid in determining the role of this virus-host cell protein interaction in Epstein-Barr virus-mediated oncogenesis.

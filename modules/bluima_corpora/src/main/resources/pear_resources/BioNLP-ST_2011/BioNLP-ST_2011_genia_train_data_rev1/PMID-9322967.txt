Human neutrophils express GH-N gene transcripts and the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1b. 
Since GH stimulates the development and function of granulocytes, we investigated the expression of GH in granulocyte subsets. By immunocytochemistry, 25 +/- 7% of the human neutrophils were shown to express immunoreactive GH, whereas eosinophils were negative. Reversed transcription (RT)-PCR analysis demonstrated GH mRNA in neutrophils. Restriction analysis revealed that neutrophils express the GH-N gene but not the GH-V gene. Furthermore, we demonstrated by western blot analysis that neutrophils express an alternatively spliced variant of the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1, designated Pit-1b.

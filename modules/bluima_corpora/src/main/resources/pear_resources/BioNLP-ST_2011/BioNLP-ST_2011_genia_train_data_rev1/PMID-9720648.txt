Nuclear factor-kappaB induction in CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ T cell subsets during aging. 
An increase in the ratio of memory to naive T cells has been postulated to underlie immune hyporesponsiveness accompanying aging. Our analyses of the induction of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) in activated memory (CD45RO+) and naive (CD45RA+) T cell subsets from young and elderly donors has demonstrated that, regardless of donor age, memory T cells are not significantly altered in their responsiveness to TNF-alpha-mediated induction of NFkappaB. Although treatment with TNF-alpha induced nuclear localization of NFkappaB in both memory and naive T cell subsets, irrespective of the age of the donor, the levels of induced NFkappaB were significantly lower in both subsets of T cells obtained from the elderly, when compared to those in young. Examination of IkappaB alpha regulation revealed that TNF-alpha-mediated degradation of IkappaB alpha in both memory and naive T cells from the elderly was severely impaired, thus contributing to the lowered induction of the observed NFkappaB. In addition, this age-related decrease in induction of nuclear NFkappaB correlated with decrease in intracellular IL-2 receptor expression and anti-CD3-induced proliferation of both memory and naive T cells subsets. Taken together, our results suggest that the age-related hyporesponsiveness cannot be attributed to a skewing of the T cell population towards a memory phenotype in the elderly.

Inducible expression and phosphorylation of coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 in T cells [see comments] 
BOB.1/OBF.1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is constitutively expressed in B cells and interacts with the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors. Upon activation of Jurkat T cells and primary murine thymocytes with phorbol esters and ionomycin, BOB.1/OBF.1 expression and transactivation function were induced. BOB.1/OBF.1 was phosphorylated at Ser184 both in vivo and in vitro, and this modification was required for inducible activation. Mutation of Ser184 also diminished transactivation function in B cells, suggesting that the activating phosphorylation that is inducible in T cells is constitutively present in B cells. Thus, BOB.1/OBF.1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is critically regulated by posttranslational modifications to mediate cell type-specific gene expression.

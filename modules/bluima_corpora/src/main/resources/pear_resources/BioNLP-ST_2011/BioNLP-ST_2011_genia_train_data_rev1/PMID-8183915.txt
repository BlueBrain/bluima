Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts encoded by the murine p105 NF-kappa B gene generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with different inhibitory activities. 
The gene encoding the 105-kDa protein (p105) precursor of the p50 subunit of transcription factor NF-kappa B also encodes a p70 I kappa B protein, I kappa B gamma, which is identical to the C-terminal 607 amino acids of p105. Here we show that alternative RNA splicing generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with properties different from those of p70. One 63-kDa isoform, termed I kappa B gamma-1, which lacks 59 amino acids C-terminal to ankyrin repeat 7, has a novel 35-amino acid C terminus encoded by an alternative reading frame of the p105 gene. A 55-kDa isoform, I kappa B gamma-2, lacks the 190 C-terminal amino acids of p70I kappa B gamma. In contrast to p70I kappa B gamma, which is a cytoplasmic protein, I kappa B gamma-1 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas I kappa B gamma-2 is predominantly nuclear. The I kappa B gamma isoforms also display differences in specificity and affinity for Rel/NF-kappa B proteins. While p70I kappa B gamma inhibits p50-, p65-, and c-Rel-mediated transactivation and/or DNA binding, both I kappa B gamma-1 and I kappa B gamma-2 are specific for p50 and have different affinities for this subunit. The absence in I kappa B gamma-1 and I kappa B gamma-2 of a protein kinase A site whose phosphorylation modulates p70I kappa B gamma inhibitory activity suggests that alternative RNA splicing may be used to generate I kappa B gamma isoforms that respond differently to intracellular signals.

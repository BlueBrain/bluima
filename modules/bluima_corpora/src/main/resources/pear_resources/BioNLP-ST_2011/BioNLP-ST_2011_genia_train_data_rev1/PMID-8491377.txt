Cloning and functional characterization of early B-cell factor, a regulator of lymphocyte-specific gene expression. 
Early B-cell factor (EBF) was identified previously as a tissue-specific and differentiation stage-specific DNA-binding protein that participates in the regulation of the pre-B and B lymphocyte-specific mb-1 gene. Partial amino acid sequences obtained from purified EBF were used to isolate cDNA clones, which by multiple criteria encode EBF. The recombinant polypeptide formed sequence-specific complexes with the EBF-binding site in the mb-1 promoter. The cDNA hybridized to multiple transcripts in pre-B and B-cell lines, but transcripts were not detected at significant levels in plasmacytoma, T-cell, and nonlymphoid cell lines. Expression of recombinant EBF in transfected nonlymphoid cells strongly activated transcription from reporter plasmids containing functional EBF-binding sites. Analysis of DNA binding by deletion mutants of EBF identified an amino-terminal cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain lacking obvious sequence similarity to known transcription factors. DNA-binding assays with cotranslated wild-type and truncated forms of EBF indicated that the protein interacts with its site as a homodimer. Deletions delineated a carboxy-terminal dimerization region containing two repeats of 15 amino acids that show similarity with the dimerization domains of basic-helix-loop-helix proteins. Together, these data suggest that EBF represents a novel regulator of B lymphocyte-specific gene expression.

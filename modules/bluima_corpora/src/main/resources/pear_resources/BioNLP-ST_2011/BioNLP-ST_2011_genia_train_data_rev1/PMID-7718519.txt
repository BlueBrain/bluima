IL-1 receptor and TCR signals synergize to activate NF-kappa B-mediated gene transcription. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)- and TCR-initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes during the competence phase of the activation program in T helper lymphocytes. In this report we describe how signals initiated through the type I IL-1R interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of NF-kappa B. The synergistic antigen receptor initiated signals are mediated through protein kinase C because they can be mimicked by the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, but not with calcium ionophores; and are staurosporine sensitive but cyclosporine resistant. Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF-kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL-1 rather than by antigen receptor signals. Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF-kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha (MAD3)-NF-kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and is not associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation. The IL-1-induced NF-kappa B DNA nuclear localization is transient and can be prolonged either by an antigen receptor-initiated signal or by inhibiting protein synthesis. These results suggest that IL-1 induces both NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein(s) responsible for terminating NF-kappa B-DNA interaction in the nucleus. Antigen receptor signals prolong NF-kappa B-DNA interaction, probably by functionally antagonizing the IL-1-induced synthesis of a protein(s) responsible for the transient NF-kappa B-DNA interaction and consequently synergistically enhance IL-1-induced NF-kappa B-dependent gene transcription.

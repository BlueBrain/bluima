LMP1 Promotes B Cell Survival and Proliferation In Vitro
(A) MTS assay of splenocytes from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice. Splenocytes were cultured in the presence (grey bars) or absence (black bars) of IL4 for 3 d. The results are the mean +/- SEM of triplicate samples averaged from multiple mice where "n" the number of mice analyzed is as follows: n = 2 for WT lymphocytes and WT lymphomas, n = 11 for LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes, and n = 13 for LMP1 transgenic lymphomas. 
(B) EMA exclusion of CD19+ gated splenocytes from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice showing percentage of viable B cells cultured with (white bars) or without (black bars) IL4 for 2 d. 
(C) Flow cytometry analysis for incorporated BrdU in WT and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells cultured with or without IL4 for 2 d. Shown are the results from WT lymphoma 1 and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 2. Percentages of cells in each quadrant are shown.

Differential regulation of proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos in T lymphocytes activated through CD28. 
The T cell surface molecule CD28 binds to ligands on accessory cells and APCs, playing an important costimulatory role in the response of T cells to Ags. Our knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways coupled to this receptor is incomplete. In addition to activation of phospholipase C gamma 1, ligation of this receptor also seems to activate a calcium-independent, CD28-specific pathway. In this paper, we report that cross-linking of CD28 (but not CD2, CD5, LFA-1, or CD7) leads to an elevation of c-jun mRNA, with only minimal activation of c-fos expression. CD28-dependent induction of c-jun expression requires protein tyrosine kinase activity, but does not depend on activation of a phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C or elevation of cytosolic calcium. Furthermore, CD28-dependent elevation of c-jun mRNA does not appear to be mediated at the level of mRNA stability. A mechanism is suggested whereby expression of c-jun and junB, in the absence of members of the fos family, can prevent inappropriate activation of T cells caused by ligation of CD28 in the absence of a specific antigenic stimulus.

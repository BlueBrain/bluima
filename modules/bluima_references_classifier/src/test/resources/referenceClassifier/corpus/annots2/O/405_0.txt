Anterior spinal artery syndrome is rare in children. In
adults, where it is observed most frequently after
resection of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, spinal magnetic resonance imaging is considered the
first-line investigation to confirm the clinical diagnosis.
A 3-year-old male who presented with this syndrome
after palliative cardiac surgery for a complex cardiac
malformation associated with aortic coarctation is presented. Clinical diagnosis of anterior horn cell impairment below the L2 level was confirmed by electromyography and F-wave studies. Sparing of dorsal sensory
tracts was documented by normal somatosensoryevoked potentials, which confirmed the anterior localization of the lesion. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging performed on day 15 and day 105 after surgery was
normal. Neurologic deficits, including flaccid paraplegia, remained stable except for the reappearance of
patellar reflexes on day 83. Neurophysiologic conduction studies were consistent with lower motoneuron
loss. In this patient, magnetic resonance imaging was
less sensitive in demonstrating spinal cord lesion than
clinical neurophysiology. Somatosensory-evoked po-tentials failed to detect the insult. Prevention may
therefore require other neurophysiologic monitoring
techniques. © 2001 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

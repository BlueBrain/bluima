Shaker-related or Kv1 voltage-gated K1 channels play
critical roles in regulating the excitability of mammalian neurons. Native Kv1 channel complexes are octamers of four integral membrane a subunits and four cytoplasmic b subunits, such that a tremendous diversity of
channel complexes can be assembled from the array of a
and b subunits expressed in the brain. However, biochemical and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that only certain complexes predominate in
the mammalian brain, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms exist that ensure plasma membrane targeting of
only physiologically appropriate channel complexes.
Here we show that Kv1 channels assembled as homo- or
heterotetrameric complexes had distinct surface ex-pression characteristics in both transfected mammalian
cells and hippocampal neurons. Homotetrameric Kv1.1
channels were localized to endoplasmic reticulum,
Kv1.4 channels to the cell surface, and Kv1.2 channels to
both endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface. Heteromeric assembly with Kv1.4 resulted in dose-dependent increases in cell surface expression of coassembled
Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, while coassembly with Kv1.1 had a
dominant-negative effect on Kv1.2 and Kv1.4 surface ex-pression. Coassembly with Kvb subunits promoted cell
surface expression of each Kv1 heteromeric complex.
These data suggest that subunit composition and stoichiometry determine surface expression characteristics
of Kv1 channels in excitable cells.

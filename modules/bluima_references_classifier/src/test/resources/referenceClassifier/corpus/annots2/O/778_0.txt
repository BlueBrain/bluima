Amyloid- (A ) is a major constituent of the neuritic
plaque found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease pa-tients, and a great deal of evidence suggests that the
neuronal loss that is associated with the disease is a
consequence of the actions of A . In the past few years,
it has become apparent that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediates some of the effects of A on
cultured cells; in particular, the evidence suggests that
A -triggered JNK activation leads to cell death. In this
study, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of A (1–40) on signaling events in the
hippocampus and on long term potentiation in Schaffer
collateral CA1 pyramidal cell synapses in vivo. We re-port that A (1–40) induced activation of JNK in CA1 and
that this was coupled with expression of the proapoptotic protein, Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, poly-(ADPribose) polymerase cleavage, and Fas ligand expression
in the hippocampus. These data indicate that A (1–40)
inhibited expression of long term potentiation, and this
effect was abrogated by administration of the JNK in-hibitor peptide, D-JNKI1. In parallel with these findings, we observed that A -induced changes in caspase-3
activation and TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling
staining in neuronal cultured cells were inhibited by
D-JNKI1. We present evidence suggesting that interleukin (IL)-1 plays a significant role in mediating the ef-fects of A (1–40) because A (1–40) increased hippocampal
IL-1 and because several effects of A (1–40) were inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CMK. On the
basis of our findings, we propose that A -induced
changes in hippocampal plasticity are likely to be de-pendent upon IL-1 -triggered activation of JNK.

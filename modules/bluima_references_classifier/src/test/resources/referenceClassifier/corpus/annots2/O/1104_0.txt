BACKGROUND
We describe the very rare condition of an idiopathic spinal
arachnoid malformation associated with syringomyelia
(SM) and depicted on preoperative magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) whose features were confirmed at surgery.

CASE DESCRIPTION
A 34-year-old female suffered from progressive gait im-pairment because of lower limb palsy and sensory disturbances. MRI demonstrated a bulging membrane at the
T6 level that was transversely stretched between the
dorsal aspect of the spinal cord and the posterior dura
mater. At this level, the spinal cord appeared atrophic
and pushed anteriorly against the dura with enlargement
of the posterior subarachnoid spaces (SAS) and focal
collapse of an associated panmedullar SM. Surgery consisted in releasing the arachnoid malformation and opening the inferior segment of the syringomyelic cavity.
Pathological examination revealed a fibro-sclerotic tissue
with cellular areas of meningo-endothelial cells. Postoperative neurological status progressively improved but
slightly. Three-months and 1 year postoperatively, MRI
showed the collapse of the whole SM and restoration of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow at the treated T6 level.

CONCLUSION
Spinal arachnoid malformations associated with SM are
very rare and have never been described up to now on
MRI. Surgical removal of the causative malformation al-lows spinal cord decompression and prevents the recurrence of the SM by restoring normal CSF circulation. ©

Rac proteins are members of the Rho family of GTPases involved in the regulation of actin dynamics. The
three highly homologous Rac proteins in mammals are the ubiquitous Rac1, the hematopoiesis-specific Rac2,
and the least-characterized Rac3. We show here that Rac3 mRNA is widely and specifically expressed in the
developing nervous system, with highest concentration at embryonic day 13 in the dorsal root ganglia and
ventral spinal cord. At postnatal day 7 Rac3 appears particularly abundant in populations of projection
neurons in several regions of the brain, including the fifth layer of the cortex and the CA1-CA3 region of the
hippocampus. We generated mice deleted for the Rac3 gene with the aim of analyzing the function of this
GTPase in vivo. Rac3 knockout animals survive embryogenesis and show no obvious developmental defects.
Interestingly, specific behavioral differences were detected in the Rac3-deficient animals, since motor coordination and motor learning on the rotarod was superior to that of their wild-type littermates. No obvious
histological or immunohistological differences were observed at major sites of Rac3 expression. Our results
indicate that, in vivo, Rac3 activity is not strictly required for normal development in utero but may be relevant
to later events in the development of a functional nervous system.

Abstract––Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor has been shown to aVect dopaminergic and
cholinergic neuron markers and functions in young rats. However, it is not known if the response to
exogenous glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor is augmented during normal aging. Thus, the eVects
of chronic intraventricular infusions of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor were determined in
young adult (three-months-old) and aged (24-months-old) Fischer 344 (F344) male rats. The eVects of
glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor were compared to the eVects of the neurotrophin nerve growth
factor. Growth factors were administered at a dose of 10 mg/day for 14 days. Locomotor activity and
weight changes were also examined in all rats. Aged F344 rats showed significantly reduced (by 75–80%)
locomotor activity compared to young rats. In glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor-treated aged and
young rats there was significantly increased (242% and 149%, respectively) locomotor activity measured at
seven days. There was also a significant increase in locomotor activity measured 14 days after the start of
infusion. Both glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor reduced weight gain by
10% in young and old F344 rats. Two weeks following the start of nerve growth factor or glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor administration the brains were used for neurochemical analyses. Glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor significantly increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the substantia
nigra and striatum of aged rats and in the substantia nigra of young rats. Nerve growth factor treatment
did not significantly aVect tyrosine hydroxylase activity. However, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor and nerve growth factor increased choline acetyltransferase activity in the septum, hippocampus,
striatum and cortex of aged rats and in the hippocampus and striatum of young rats to a comparable
degree.
These findings indicate that specific dopaminergic and cholinergic neuron populations remain responsive to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor during the life span of the rat and may be involved in
maintaining phenotypic expression within multiple neuronal populations. Additionally, the glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor-induced up-regulation of brain neurotransmitter systems may be responsible for increased locomotor activity in F344 rats. ? 1997 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

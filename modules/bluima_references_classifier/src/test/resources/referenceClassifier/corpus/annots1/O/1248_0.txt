Synaptic input to a neuron may undergo various filtering steps, both locally and during transmission to the soma. Using simultaneous
whole-cell recordings from soma and apical dendrites from rat CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, and biophysically detailed modeling,
we found two complementary resonance (bandpass) filters of subthreshold voltage signals. Both filters favor signals in the theta (3–12
Hz) frequency range, but have opposite location, direction, and voltage dependencies: (1) dendritic H-resonance, caused by h/HCNchannels, filters signals propagating from soma to dendrite when the membrane potential is close to rest; and (2) somatic M-resonance,
caused by M/Kv7/KCNQ and persistent Na (NaP) channels, filters signals propagating from dendrite to soma when the membrane
potential approaches spike threshold. Hippocampal pyramidal cells participate in theta network oscillations during behavior, and we
suggest that that these dual, polarized theta resonance mechanisms may convey voltage-dependent tuning of theta-mediated neural
coding in the entorhinal/hippocampal system during locomotion, spatial navigation, memory, and sleep.

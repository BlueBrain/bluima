Voltage-clamp recordings from layer II neurones in somatosensory cortex of rats aged between 12
and 17 days showed a high frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs), which on
average was 33 ± 13 Hz (S.D.). sPSCs were mediated largely by glutamatergic AMPA receptors.
Their rates and amplitudes were independent of blocking sodium channels with 1 mM tetrodotoxin
(TTX). Most of them, therefore, represent genuine miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents
(mEPSCs). The rise time of the fastest (10 %) mEPSCs was 288 ± 86 ms (10–90 %) and the halfwidth was 1073 ± 532 ms. The amplitude was _5.9 ± 1.1 pA with a coefficient of variation (CV) of
0.44 ± 0.14. The rate of mEPSCs was very temperature sensitive with a Q10 (33–37 °C) of 8.9 ± 0.9.
Due to this temperature sensitivity, we estimated that the microscope lamp contributed an increase
in temperature of about 4 °C to the tissue in the focal volume of the condenser. Cell-type differences
in the rate of mEPSCs were found between pyramidal/multipolar and bipolar cells. The latter had a
frequency of about a third of that seen in the other cell groups. Recordings in layer II are ideally
suited to investigate mechanisms of spontaneous transmitter release.

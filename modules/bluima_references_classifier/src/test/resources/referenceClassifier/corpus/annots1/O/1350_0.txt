In recent years, many new cortical areas have been
identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even
more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of
the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and
with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for
storing and representing large amounts of information
on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these
data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the
cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual
system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are
predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an
additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association
areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A
total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and
visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31 % of the possible number of pathways if each
area were connected with all others. The actual degree
of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great
majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections be-tween areas. There are also extensive connections with
cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including
the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and
frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there
are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas,
suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based
on the laminar patterns of connections between areas,
we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than
those suggested in other recent studies. The current
version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of
cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if
one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus
at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are
multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a
low level, are related to the compartmental organization
of areas VI and V2 and, at a high level, are related to
the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose
descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical
scheme for one reason or another. In most instances,
though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine
exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies
or uncertainties in the reported assignment.

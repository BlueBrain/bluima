GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, has recently emerged as an important signal in network development. Most of the
trophic functions of GABA have been attributed to depolarization of the embryonic and neonatal neurons via the activation of ionotropic GABA

receptors. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which endogenous GABA selectively regulates the development of GABAergic synapses
in the developing brain. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on newborn mouse hippocampi lacking functional GABA receptors (GABABB
Rs) and time-lapse fluorescence imaging on cultured hippocampal neurons expressing GFP-tagged brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
we found that activation of metabotropic GABA receptors (GABA -Rs) triggers secretion of BDNF and promotes the development of perisoBB
matic GABAergic synapses in the newborn mouse hippocampus. Because activation of GABA -Rs occurs during the characteristic ongoing

physiological network-driven synaptic activity present in the developing hippocampus, our results reveal a new mechanism by which synaptic
activity can modulate the development of local GABAergic synaptic connections in the developing brain.

Despite decades of evidence for functional plasticity in the adult brain, the role of structural plasticity in its
manifestation remains unclear. To examine the extent of neuronal remodeling that occurs in the brain on a day-to-day
basis, we used a multiphoton-based microscopy system for chronic in vivo imaging and reconstruction of entire
neurons in the superficial layers of the rodent cerebral cortex. Here we show the first unambiguous evidence (to our
knowledge) of dendrite growth and remodeling in adult neurons. Over a period of months, neurons could be seen
extending and retracting existing branches, and in rare cases adding new branch tips. Neurons exhibiting dynamic
arbor rearrangements were GABA-positive non-pyramidal interneurons, while pyramidal cells remained stable. These
results are consistent with the idea that dendritic structural remodeling is a substrate for adult plasticity and they
suggest that circuit rearrangement in the adult cortex is restricted by cell type–specific rules.

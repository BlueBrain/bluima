ABSTRACT
We have identified two discrete transactivation domains within the mouse oestrogen receptor whose
relative activities vary according to the target promoter. One domain lies within the N-terminal region
and is active in the absence of oestradiol. The second domain is contained within the C-terminal
portion of the protein and depends upon oestrogen binding for its activity. The location and oestrogen
dependence of this domain has been confirmed using chimaeric receptors containing the Lex A DNA
binding domain. Although transactivation by the C-terminal domain is dependent upon ligand binding
the analysis of receptor deletion mutants has demonstrated that these two functions are not entirely
coincident.

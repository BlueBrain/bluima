The entorhinal cortex (EC) receives prominent cholinergic innervation from the medial
septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MSDB). To understand
how cholinergic neurotransmission can modulate behavior, research has been directed
toward identification of the specific cellular mechanisms in EC that can be modulated
through cholinergic activity. This review focuses on intrinsic cellular properties of neurons
in EC that may underlie functions such as working memory, spatial processing, and
episodic memory. In particular, the study of stellate cells (SCs) in medial entorhinal has
resulted in discovery of correlations between physiological properties of these neurons
and properties of the unique spatial representation that is demonstrated through unit
recordings of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) from awake-behaving animals.
A separate line of investigation has demonstrated persistent firing behavior among
neurons in EC that is enhanced by cholinergic activity and could underlie working
memory. There is also evidence that acetylcholine plays a role in modulation of synaptic
transmission that could also enhance mnemonic function in EC. Finally, the local circuits
of EC demonstrate a variety of interneuron physiology, which is also subject to cholinergic
modulation. Together these effects alter the dynamics of EC to underlie the functional role
of acetylcholine in memory.

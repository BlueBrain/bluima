On closer inspection, however, the axonal segments are shorter and projected more radially compared with Horizontal Axon Cells. Particularly many short branches emerged from long axonal collaterals. They display the longest total length of axon, the highest number of segments, and the highest maximum branch order among Layer I neuronal classes. The axonal collaterals of more than 50% of Large Axon Cells were often seen to project vertically into Layer II and Layer III. Their dendrites also displayed the highest segment number indicating frequently branching." []

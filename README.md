Bluima:: UIMA components at BlueBrain
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BlueBrain/bluima.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BlueBrain/bluima)


### About

Bluima is a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline focusing on the extraction of neuroscientific content and based on the [UIMA framework](http://uima.apache.org/). Bluima builds upon models from biomedical NLP (BioNLP) like specialized tokenizers and lemmatizers. It adds further models and tools specific to neuroscience (e.g. named entity recognizer for neuron or brain region mentions) and provides collection readers for neuroscientific corpora.

### Dependencies

* Java JDK 7 or higher (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* Maven 3			   (http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation)


### Configure

Setup BLUIMA_HOME, e.g. (in your .bash_profile):

    export BLUIMA_HOME={absolute path to Bluima}


### Build

    > export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx4G -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
    > mvn clean install -Dblue_uima_home={PATH_TO_HOME}

Get yourself a coffee. Rinse and repeat above command if error is "could not download artifacts"

If gpg signing is not setup and you simply want to skip it then you can add `-Dgpg.skip=true` to the maven command line options.


### Maven Tests

* The reference test environment is the command line.
* Run all tests
      > mvn clean test
* Skip tests while building
      > mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true


### Eclipse

* Tested with 4.2 and latest m2e plugin
* Make sure you have built the codebase with the above step (`mvn`)
* Import the module `bluima_bbp` with: File -> Import... -> Existing Maven Projects
* Set BLUIMA_HOME in Eclipse
 * Preferences: Java > Installed JRE > Edit
 * -Xms1G -Xmx4G -Dbluima_home={absolute path to Bluima}
* Test your installation (see "Getting Started" below)
* Import other modules you need with: File -> Import... -> Existing Maven Projects

### Release

    > cd modules/bluima
    > sh release.sh

The release includes all dependencies can be deployed on any computer with a JRE (e.g. cluster).


### Conventions (over configuration)

* Maven projects are named bluima_{project-name}
* Class naming conventions
 * UIMA Analysis Engines are named   `Annotator`
 * UIMA Collection Readers are named `CollectionReader`
 * UIMA Cas Consumers are named      `Writer`
 * JUnit tests are named {base-class}Test

### Getting Started

* launch the class `ch.epfl.bbp.uima.RunPipeline` in project `bluima_bbp`
* select a pipeline to run, e.g. `examples/1_simple/simple.pipeline`


### Feedback

* is welcome: renaud.richardet@epfl.ch
